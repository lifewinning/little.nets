					<p>When we talk about what the web could be, it is often with nostalgia for a web that was&mdash;or a web that we think might have been, but we missed it. We tend to trip over our words whenever we talk about the web in any non-trivial way. Anything we say is so easily dated, or sound incredibly pretentious, and nothing ever is true to the whole place, because it simply can't be true to the whole place.</p>
					<p>These are some of the writings that have shaped the way I think about and talk about the network.  Some of them are kind of "weird old internet" texts of internet history and some of them are from now, and are a little bit urgent. All of them are probably important to me because they have this ideal mix of sincerity, uncertainty, and unexpected grace. 
					<p>For texts that I read online, I've saved the pages as accurately as wget would allow. They're sort of like weird scrapbook objects that way.</p>
					<p>Spend some time with them on this network and maybe they'll give you something to think about for <em>the</em> network.</p>
