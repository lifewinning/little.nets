The network consists of a handful of Raspberry Pis, distributed throughout the house, tucked away in discrete corners. Each computer has a unique voice that it broadcasts over local airwaves. Walking from room to room, the audible signal from each Raspberry Pi will fade in and out as you move towards and away from each station. Put on one of the provided wireless FM headphones and tune into an aural sensory experience on 90.1 House FM.",
