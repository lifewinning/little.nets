<a name="l220"></a>The Ken at Xytec was one of the most saintly, Christian people I have met.  He 
<a name="l221"></a>was laid-back and dull almost to a fault.  No, not almost, he was, actually, 
<a name="l222"></a>dull to a fault, LOL.  He was smart, though.  He was raising a son.  At 
<a name="l223"></a>Ticketmaster, my previous job, it was college-aged single people.  That Xytec 
<a name="l224"></a>company was depressing in how conservative, professional and dull it was.  The

<a name="l241"></a>Ken was a mighty man, maybe, an angel.  Ken's son rebelled -- he played drums

<a name="l244"></a>
<a name="l245"></a>It's a difficult concept to explain -- God lies.  It's more like joshing in an

<a name="l260"></a>speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
<a name="l261"></a>
<a name="l262"></a>2:2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
<a name="l263"></a>Christ, and him crucified.
<a name="l264"></a>
<a name="l265"></a>2:3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much
<a name="l266"></a>trembling.
<a name="l267"></a>
<a name="l268"></a>2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of
<a name="l269"></a>man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 2:5
<a name="l270"></a>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the
<a name="l271"></a>power of God.
<a name="l272"></a>
<a name="l273"></a>2:6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the
<a name="l274"></a>wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to
<a name="l275"></a>nought: 2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
<a name="l276"></a>hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: 2:8
<a name="l277"></a>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it,
<a name="l278"></a>they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
<a name="l279"></a>
<a name="l280"></a>2:9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
<a name="l281"></a>have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared
<a name="l282"></a>for them that love him.
<a name="l283"></a>
<a name="l284"></a>2:10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit
<a name="l285"></a>searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
<a name="l286"></a>
<a name="l287"></a>2:11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
<a name="l288"></a>which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the
<a name="l289"></a>Spirit of God.
<a name="l290"></a>
<a name="l291"></a>2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit
<a name="l292"></a>which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given
<a name="l293"></a>to us of God.
<a name="l294"></a>
<a name="l295"></a>2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom
<a name="l296"></a>teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual
<a name="l297"></a>things with spiritual.
<a name="l298"></a>
<a name="l299"></a>2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
<a name="l300"></a>God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
<a name="l301"></a>because they are spiritually discerned.
<a name="l302"></a>
<a name="l303"></a>2:15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is
<a name="l304"></a>judged of no man.
<a name="l305"></a>
<a name="l306"></a>2:16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
