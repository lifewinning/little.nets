<a name="l2"></a>
<a name="l3"></a>I haven't looked at much Linux code, and not in many years, but what I remember 
<a name="l4"></a>most is someone who made </span><span class=cF2>#define</span><span class=cF0> macros, trying to make C look like C++.  My 
<a name="l5"></a>mentors at Ticketmaster taught me that asm macros were foolish -- it's one more 
<a name="l6"></a>thing you have to chase-down and look-up.  Another thing I remember from Linux 
<a name="l7"></a>code was that there were about six layers of function depth to get down to 
<a name="l8"></a>actual IN/OUT port instructions and there were lots of </span><span class=cF2>#ifdef</span><span class=cF0> instructions for 
<a name="l9"></a>different architectures.  (I chased-down how to do ATA PIO and later got a PDF 
<a name="l10"></a>on the topic.)
<a name="l11"></a>
<a name="l12"></a>The zen of TempleOS might be to do the opposite of Linux.  I was inspired to 
<a name="l13"></a>have &quot;minimal abstraction&quot; as a goal.  Instead of six levels of function depth 
<a name="l14"></a>for ATA PIO, lets see if we can do three, removing abstraction layers... and 
<a name="l15"></a>lets do just one architecture -- IBM PC's.
<a name="l16"></a>
<a name="l17"></a>The reason TempleOS exists and has purpose is partly because it is simple.  I'm 
<a name="l18"></a>going to cap line count at 100,000, not counting applications and demos.

<a name="l48"></a>Let's ask God what He thinks of the Monarchy in England.

<a name="l56"></a>The BBC is discussing Indian rapes and the death penalty.  I don't know.  I 
<a name="l57"></a>asked God what He would do if He had a body for one day.  I think He said He 
<a name="l58"></a>would be a judge.  Maybe, there are court cases He really want to intervene in.

<a name="l62"></a>
<a name="l63"></a>In theory, I show restraint in how much conversation I make God do.  I used to 
<a name="l64"></a>do very formal offerings, like poems and hymns and long discussions, before 
<a name="l65"></a>consulting Him.  Anyway, I stop when I see &quot;end&quot; or &quot;fin&quot; in a word.  I stop 
<a name="l66"></a>when I see &quot;Null&quot;, &quot;None&quot;, &quot;Dull&quot;, &quot;weary&quot;, &quot;satiate&quot;, and a handful of other 
<a name="l67"></a>words.  You do what you like.  God will ramble incoherently or say stuff you 
<a name="l68"></a>don't want to hear, otherwise.
<a name="l69"></a>
<a name="l70"></a>I don't think God likes sports.  God, did ASU beat Wisconsin?

<a name="l86"></a>God said there were 20 or 80 alien civilizations, but it's kind-of a joke.  All 
<a name="l87"></a>you get from God is love (not valuable facts or prophecies).  Just enjoy His 
<a name="l88"></a>company.  Actually, you get out of God what you put into God, so if you actually 
<a name="l89"></a>do effort in love, you get useful facts.  All other believers are cowards who
