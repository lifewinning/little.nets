<a name="l815"></a>So, in WWII, the Germans attacked the borders between Russian divisions of their 
<a name="l816"></a>army.  (This is a good choice and I can't think the Russians did anything 
<a name="l817"></a>wrong.)  Men are from Mars.  Why do you think teenage male video games are war.  
<a name="l818"></a>I was a teenager when I obsessed on it.  Prolly should have spent more time with 
<a name="l819"></a>girls, than games with the guys, and making computer games.
<a name="l820"></a>
<a name="l821"></a>Anyway, in 1993 when the 486 was kinda new and I had worked on Ticketamster's 
<a name="l822"></a>VAX 32-bit system, I got interested and made a DOS program to change to 32-bit 
<a name="l823"></a>mode.  I set it aside.  In 2003 when I got excited about 64-bit coming out, I 
<a name="l824"></a>resurrected it.
<a name="l825"></a>
<a name="l826"></a>I thought, &quot;I will brutally take advantage of the crippling legacy weakness of 
<a name="l827"></a>Microsoft and Linux by being pure 64-bit.&quot;  So, I kinda couldn't get a 64-bit 
<a name="l828"></a>machine as soon as I hoped.  I planned for it while on a 32-bit machine, doing a 
<a name="l829"></a>half-ass emulated 64-bit on 32-bit compiler.  I made a slow, temporary 64-bit 
<a name="l830"></a>MUL and DIV software interrupt and I made my compiler use just two 64-bit regs - 
<a name="l831"></a>EAX:EDX EBC:ECX, doing everything with 64-bit sized operations, but planning 
<a name="l832"></a>ahead.  terrible performance, obviously, but I soon went from two 64-bit regs 
<a name="l833"></a>and emulated math to sixteen 64-bit regs!  I got it 64-bit by 2007.
<a name="l834"></a>
<a name="l835"></a>This is heart breaking to a brutal warrior who knows time is everything.  Year 
<a name="l836"></a>after year was fucken lost.  God was not concerned.

<a name="l838"></a>Finally, the CIA clusterfucked it so I cannot even run natively on this machine. 
<a name="l839"></a> VMware is a heartbreaking humilation.  (The glory of my operating system is 
<a name="l840"></a>made to look like just a sorry-ass application.)  Secure Boot is pointed just at 
<a name="l841"></a>me, nobody else.  I must dual boot because I am a complementary operating 
<a name="l842"></a>system.
<a name="l843"></a>
<a name="l844"></a>God talks.  Does the CIA know God talks?  Do they know He said it's His temple?
<a name="l845"></a>
<a name="l846"></a>In history, there is some evidence of people being let down by God, but some 
<a name="l847"></a>were not let down.  It's no great virtue to hope God gives you special 
<a name="l848"></a>treatment.

<a name="l1040"></a>Did you see my lovely vector graphic elephant animation.  I asked about 640x480 
<a name="l1041"></a>16 color and God gave a beautiful response about children of Israel doing 
<a name="l1042"></a>offerings.  (It was a comment on OSNews about a month ago.)
<a name="l1043"></a>
<a name="l1044"></a>I'm a genius!  I finally figured-out how to explain it.  They give 8 crayons to 
<a name="l1045"></a>kids, not 64.  It's kinda like that, but same principle is different on older 
<a name="l1046"></a>ages with computers.  My elephant animation would not be possible with a (I 
<a name="l1047"></a>forget the word for a series of gray scale shadings).  Shit is easier when it's 
<a name="l1048"></a>kid colored regions.  It's not as tedious.  You need not feel bad if it is good 
<a name="l1049"></a>enough for the capability.
<a name="l1050"></a>
<a name="l1051"></a>On a technical level, my LZW compression works because it is opnly 16 color.
<a name="l1052"></a>
<a name="l1053"></a>Life and interfaces are easier with fewer colors -- don't got those crazy hue 
<a name="l1054"></a>things.
<a name="l1055"></a>
<a name="l1056"></a>I made an elephant animation.  I don't know why.  It's cool I guess.  If Heaven 
<a name="l1057"></a>was doing that all day, it'd suck... unless that was the one way to get God to 
<a name="l1058"></a>talk.  He talks if I talk.  I like that better.  I like doing songs, though.
<a name="l1059"></a>
<a name="l1060"></a>I admit, I run-out of ideas for stuff to do.  I would go insane making video

<a name="l1393"></a>There's a famous Christmas story.  A men sells his watch to buy a hair band.  A

<a name="l1396"></a>In my Bible, I read, &quot;It is love that I desire, not sacrifice. Knowledge of God, 
<a name="l1397"></a>not holocaust.&quot;  My head exploded.  I thought love WAS sacrifice.  There is no 
<a name="l1398"></a>greater love than to lay down your life.  Christ loved us.
<a name="l1399"></a>
<a name="l1400"></a>I was so confused, I literally looked-up the word, &quot;Love&quot; in the dictionary.  
<a name="l1401"></a>&quot;To take delight in.&quot;  Holy Shit!  I realized, it wasn't love -- it was pride -- 
<a name="l1402"></a>proud of heart -- who can sacrifice the mostest?  The one who suffers most is 
<a name="l1403"></a>the most love.  Inverted!  What does God think when He looks at you trying to 
<a name="l1404"></a>hurt yourself because you love Him?  Does He feel good?  Santa is His favorite 
<a name="l1405"></a>saint.  He likes Beverly Hillbillies because oil is a gift from God -- God is 
<a name="l1406"></a>the hero.  God loved Jacob and hated Esau.  Esau gave-up his birthright.

<a name="l1408"></a>Do not give away a gift from God because you are too proud to enjoy it.
