<a name="l2"></a>
<a name="l3"></a>I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  He asked if I was calling Him 
<a name="l4"></a>lazy.  I decided there are three main things which make people think the World 
<a name="l5"></a>is not just -- money, early-death, and slavery.
<a name="l6"></a>
<a name="l7"></a>MONEY:  I have noticed when you have something good for a while, you get sick of 
<a name="l8"></a>it and it is not special.  And, when you have something bad, you get used to it. 
<a name="l9"></a>Also, imagine being Paul McCartney.  He has money from his youth, but might feel 
<a name="l10"></a>pretty useless (except for interacting with his family).  God did says, however, 
<a name="l11"></a>that having enough money was &quot;vehemently better&quot;.  The Bible seems to say that 
<a name="l12"></a>highs and lows balance -- you will want for money for a period as long you have 
<a name="l13"></a>an abundance.  </span><a href="../../../../../../../Misc/Bible.html#l56115"><span class=cF4>Proverbs,30:8</span></a><span class=cF0>, </span><a href="../../../../../../../Misc/Bible.html#l82705"><span class=cF4>Luke,6:21</span></a><span class=cF0>
<a name="l14"></a>
<a name="l15"></a>EARLY-DEATH:  &quot;Old age is not for wimps&quot; is a profound saying.  Did you know 
<a name="l16"></a>that every 80-year-old has spent more time fearing imminent death than a 
<a name="l17"></a>soldier?  Also, it looks like pleasures and pains balance.  Therefore, an early 
<a name="l18"></a>death might occur with accounts reconciled, just like a late death.
<a name="l19"></a>
<a name="l20"></a>SLAVERY: The poor in the Titanic movie behaved like rambunctious animals while 
<a name="l21"></a>the rich lived in straight-jackets.  We don't have slavery, anymore, but 
<a name="l22"></a>consider the time it existed and the alternative -- a hard life in Africa, 
<a name="l23"></a>possibly starving.  My brother, a labor union liberal said, &quot;The slaves were 
<a name="l24"></a>valuable property and had health care.&quot;  Which is more unpleasant, school for a 
<a name="l25"></a>struggling black kid or working in fields?  Do you think Hollywood depicts more 
<a name="l26"></a>or less cruelty than actually existed?

<a name="l34"></a>the way that thou shouldest go.
<a name="l35"></a>
<a name="l36"></a>48:18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
<a name="l37"></a>peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:

<a name="l47"></a>----09/20/13 19:09:45----
<a name="l48"></a>
<a name="l49"></a>I was struck by the symmetry of giving orders and taking orders:
<a name="l50"></a>
<a name="l51"></a></span><span class=cF2>8:5 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a
<a name="l52"></a>centurion, beseeching him, 8:6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at
<a name="l53"></a>home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
<a name="l54"></a>
<a name="l55"></a>8:7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
<a name="l56"></a>
<a name="l57"></a>8:8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou
<a name="l58"></a>shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant
<a name="l59"></a>shall be healed.
<a name="l60"></a>
<a name="l61"></a>8:9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I
<a name="l62"></a>say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he
<a name="l63"></a>cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l64"></a>
<a name="l65"></a>Eye-for-eye, tooth-for-tooth is how justice works, as a matter of fact.  Does an 
<a name="l66"></a>officer give as many orders as he takes?  Perhaps, if you consider following an 
<a name="l67"></a>officer code of conduct, then, &quot;yes&quot;.
<a name="l68"></a>
<a name="l69"></a></span><span class=cF2>30:21 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it
<a name="l70"></a>cannot bear: 30:22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he
<a name="l71"></a>is filled with meat; 30:23 For an odious woman when she is married;
<a name="l72"></a>and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l73"></a>
<a name="l74"></a>The neuvo riche behave badly.  Look at Michael Jackson.  That's not class.
<a name="l75"></a>
<a name="l76"></a>If a website does not meet standards of professionalism, it is not taken 
<a name="l77"></a>seriously.  A company CEO must behave himself.  If you accept corporate 
<a name="l78"></a>sponsorship, you must behave.
<a name="l79"></a>
<a name="l80"></a>God says...
<a name="l81"></a></span><span class=cF4>shalt thou serve, and to
<a name="l82"></a>him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.
<a name="l83"></a>
<a name="l84"></a>10:21 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee
<a name="l85"></a>these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
<a name="l86"></a>
<a name="l87"></a>10:22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
<a name="l88"></a>persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of
<a name="l89"></a>heaven for multitude.
<a name="l90"></a>
<a name="l91"></a>11:1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,
<a name="l92"></a>and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.
<a name="l93"></a>

<a name="l125"></a>I like elephants and birds.  God likes bears, then elephants.
<a name="l126"></a>
<a name="l127"></a>Someone did a dick on a oscilloscope on Reddit.  I have a master's in electrical 
<a name="l128"></a>engineering.  Sometimes, I miss doing that.  Not really.
<a name="l129"></a>
<a name="l130"></a>Did you ever have Tinker-Toys?  They seem neat until you actually sit-down to 
<a name="l131"></a>build with them.  They are more limited than Legos.  Tinker-Toys can do some 
<a name="l132"></a>special things, but you know what I am talking about.
<a name="l133"></a>
<a name="l134"></a>I thought DSP, digital signal processions, was neat.  I thought FPGAs were neat. 
<a name="l135"></a>But doing filters gets old.  You can do a CPU in a FPGA, but it's pointless.
<a name="l136"></a>
<a name="l137"></a>I have done just about everything you can do with microcontrollers.  I had to 
<a name="l138"></a>actually scratch all my itches, doing stuff, before I realized, &quot;This really 
<a name="l139"></a>isn't that fun.&quot;  I have played with A-2-D and D-2-A converters.  I don't have 
<a name="l140"></a>any more passion for electrical engineering.  I did a stepper-motor controller 
<a name="l141"></a>and made a 3-Axis milling machine with a dremel tool.
<a name="l142"></a>
<a name="l143"></a>I grew-up -- I have played with toys all I want to.  I never play video games, 
<a name="l144"></a>anymore, either.

<a name="l163"></a>One time, I decided honesty was obviously best with God.  So, I set-out to tell 
<a name="l164"></a>God all the creatures I really didn't like.  &quot;I don't like worms and grubs and 
<a name="l165"></a>snails and slugs.&quot;  God burst into tears!

<a name="l173"></a>
<a name="l174"></a>19:15 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
<a name="l175"></a>Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
<a name="l176"></a>
<a name="l177"></a>19:16 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,

<a name="l235"></a>wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
