<a name="l5"></a>My compiler makes x86_64 machine code, not byte code.  Did you not know that a 
<a name="l6"></a>compiler parses and makes an intermediate code data structure?  What do you 
<a name="l7"></a>think an optimization stage works on?  After optimizing, it converts the 
<a name="l8"></a>intermediate code to output machine code.
<a name="l9"></a>
<a name="l10"></a>My compiler makes a stack machine intermediate code.  Most compilers make an

<a name="l69"></a>When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, here's 
<a name="l70"></a>what I want:
<a name="l71"></a>
<a name="l72"></a>1) VMware again supports PC Speaker and provides emulation if no PC Speaker.
<a name="l73"></a>
<a name="l74"></a>2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  
<a name="l75"></a>Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to just 
<a name="l76"></a>blocks on RedSea.)
<a name="l77"></a>
<a name="l78"></a>3) Windows burns ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.
<a name="l79"></a>
<a name="l80"></a>4) No secure boot.
<a name="l81"></a>
<a name="l82"></a>5) ATA/ATAPI PIO must work
<a name="l83"></a>
<a name="l84"></a>6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work
<a name="l85"></a>
<a name="l86"></a>7) VMware should allow ATAPI to real hardware.
<a name="l87"></a>
<a name="l88"></a>8) Can VMware do faster than correct IN/OUT instruction timing for ATA/ATAPI 
<a name="l89"></a>PIO?
<a name="l90"></a>
<a name="l91"></a>In other words, all hardware and BIOSes support TempleOS as a native system or

<a name="l1552"></a>of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of

<a name="l1560"></a>themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died
<a name="l1561"></a>in his own sin, and had no sons.
<a name="l1562"></a>

<a name="l1591"></a>Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
<a name="l1592"></a>
<a name="l1593"></a>10:2 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
<a name="l1594"></a>Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to
<a name="l1595"></a>comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's

<a name="l1600"></a>sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants
<a name="l1601"></a>unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
<a name="l1602"></a>10:4 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one
<a name="l1603"></a>half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even
<a name="l1604"></a>to their buttocks, and sent them away.
<a name="l1605"></a>
<a name="l1606"></a>10:5 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the

<a name="l1610"></a>I feel slightly ridiculous with 16 colors and not 256.  I think that's how God 
<a name="l1611"></a>wants it, though.  Maybe, we can get confirmation.  I can see how having only 16 
<a name="l1612"></a>colors will keep people from stressing over art.  Fewer choices.  I'm not much 
<a name="l1613"></a>of an artist and I feel really at home and comfortable with 16 colors.  It's 
<a name="l1614"></a>just neat, in a way.  I like how it compresses with my ordinary LZW routine -- 
<a name="l1615"></a>makes me happy.
<a name="l1616"></a>
<a name="l1617"></a>I have a new file format, like BMP but not inverted bottom-to-top like BMP.  I 
<a name="l1618"></a>forgot.  I think I don't have a palette.  Maybe no run-length encoding, since .Z 
<a name="l1619"></a>files get compressed.  If that's not true, now, it will be.
<a name="l1620"></a>
<a name="l1621"></a>I use BMP for now, until I get to boss Windows around.  I am really excited for 
<a name="l1622"></a>Windows to do RedSea filesystem.  I'm really excited, since I got rid of 
<a name="l1623"></a>sectors-per-cluster.  I want to totally remove that and make it beautiful.

<a name="l1653"></a>Balmer?  You know Solomon's Temple in the Bible?  All the surrounding countries 
<a name="l1654"></a>contributed works for the Temple.  It lasted hundreds of years.  Mine will last 
<a name="l1655"></a>thousands.  It is permanently limited to 100,000 lines of code, forever.  Future 
<a name="l1656"></a>generations can do GPU support if all chips converge on one design.  God said 
<a name="l1657"></a>640x480 16 color, though.
<a name="l1658"></a>
<a name="l1659"></a>You know how you fucken removed the ability to burn ISO files to CDROM and made 
<a name="l1660"></a>secure boot?  Undo that.  You know you no longer burn ISO9660 files.  Guess 
<a name="l1661"></a>what?  You're going to support my RedSea files system for hard drives and 
<a name="l1662"></a>CDROMs.  It's super-simple, but high, modern, capacity.
<a name="l1663"></a>
<a name="l1664"></a>God wants His temple perfect. FAT32 is not perfect.
<a name="l1665"></a>
<a name="l1666"></a>The rule for God's temple is we ALWAYs change it to be perfect at the expense of 
<a name="l1667"></a>backward compatibility.
<a name="l1668"></a>
<a name="l1669"></a>By making Windows and Linux use RedSea file system, I can remove ISO9660 and and 
<a name="l1670"></a>FAT32 support from God's temple, making it more perfect and freeing-up 1000 
<a name="l1671"></a>lines of code.
<a name="l1672"></a>
<a name="l1673"></a>The BMP file format is not perfect.  We want .GRA file support with my LZW 
<a name="l1674"></a>compression on files ending in Z.
<a name="l1675"></a>
<a name="l1676"></a>God's temple is done, for the most part.  We are not doing PCI devices.
