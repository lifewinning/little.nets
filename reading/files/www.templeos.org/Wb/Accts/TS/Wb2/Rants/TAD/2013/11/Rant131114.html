<a name="l527"></a>When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
<a name="l528"></a>publically, here's what I want:
<a name="l529"></a>
<a name="l530"></a>1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is 
<a name="l531"></a>present.
<a name="l532"></a>
<a name="l533"></a>2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  
<a name="l534"></a>Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished code.)  
<a name="l535"></a>
<a name="l536"></a>3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
<a name="l537"></a>option, so CD/DVD is what we use.
<a name="l538"></a>
<a name="l539"></a>4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used 
<a name="l540"></a>along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.
<a name="l541"></a>
<a name="l542"></a>5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.
<a name="l543"></a>
<a name="l544"></a>6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.
<a name="l545"></a>
<a name="l546"></a>7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.
<a name="l547"></a>
<a name="l548"></a>8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing 
<a name="l549"></a>for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.
<a name="l550"></a>
<a name="l551"></a>9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating 
<a name="l552"></a>systems.
<a name="l553"></a>
<a name="l554"></a>10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS </span><span class=cF2>.GRA</span><span class=cF0> graphics files.  These are 
<a name="l555"></a>just right-side-up </span><span class=cF2>.BMP</span><span class=cF0> files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, 
<a name="l556"></a>with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea </span><span class=cF2>.Z</span><span class=cF0> LZW compression.  (Let me 
<a name="l557"></a>know when you want it.)
<a name="l558"></a>
<a name="l559"></a>In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as 
<a name="l560"></a>a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.
<a name="l561"></a>
<a name="l562"></a>It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
<a name="l563"></a>will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
<a name="l564"></a>Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

<a name="l1999"></a>8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine
<a name="l2000"></a>hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the
<a name="l2001"></a>ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
<a name="l2002"></a>
<a name="l2003"></a>8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the
<a name="l2004"></a>frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
<a name="l2005"></a>
<a name="l2006"></a>8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up
<a name="l2007"></a>frogs upon the land of Egypt.
<a name="l2008"></a>
<a name="l2009"></a>8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the
<a name="l2010"></a>LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and
<a name="l2011"></a>I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.
<a name="l2012"></a>
<a name="l2013"></a>8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat
<a name="l2014"></a>for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the
<a name="l2015"></a>frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river</span><span class=cF0>

<a name="l2017"></a>Not sure.
<a name="l2018"></a>
<a name="l2019"></a>Oh.  That's about French people.  I'm 3/4 Irish and 1/4 French.
<a name="l2020"></a>
<a name="l2021"></a>French people might not be really enthused about things which fall-out from the 
<a name="l2022"></a>Bible in English.
<a name="l2023"></a>
<a name="l2024"></a>Stereotypically, French people are arrogant.  German people are straight-forward 
<a name="l2025"></a>and simple.
