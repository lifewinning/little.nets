<a name="l133"></a>Twain had a line in King Arthur's Court, &quot;The delusion was perfect, but it just 
<a name="l134"></a>didn't delude.&quot;
<a name="l135"></a>
<a name="l136"></a></span><a href="http://www.osdev.org"><span class=cF4>WWW.OSDEV.ORG</span></a><span class=cF0> is talking about a cross compiler.  In my jail, all media talks to 
<a name="l137"></a>me.  That one didn't make much sense.
<a name="l138"></a>
<a name="l139"></a>Perhaps, they have made a </span><a href="../../../../../../../Doc/HolyC.html#l1"><span class=cF4>HolyC</span></a><span class=cF0> compiler?  Impossible -- my calling convention 
<a name="l140"></a>does not use regs to pass args into functions.
<a name="l141"></a>
<a name="l142"></a>You really should write JIT code, not BIN files.
<a name="l143"></a>
<a name="l144"></a>So, at boot, my Adam task compiles headers and 50,000 lines of additional code.  
<a name="l145"></a>This fills the Adam symbol table.  When you compile other stuff JIT, it uses the 
<a name="l146"></a>Adam task's symbol table, so you never need to deal with header files.
<a name="l147"></a>
<a name="l148"></a>If you attempted to make an old-school BIN file, you can include 
<a name="l149"></a></span><a href="../../../../../../../Kernel/AOT.html#l1"><span class=cF4>::/Kernel/AOT.HPP</span></a><span class=cF0> which will import Adam's symbols and allow you to compile.
<a name="l150"></a>
<a name="l151"></a>What you might be asking is if I could write a symboltable-to-header routine.  
<a name="l152"></a>It would dump the symbol table and make HolyC headers.  It wouldn't be that 
<a name="l153"></a>hard.  You would make two passes.  First pass, you would create class and 
<a name="l154"></a>#define entries.  The second pass you would create function headers.  Class 
<a name="l155"></a>dependencies would be a problem.  I guess you make three passes, first you 
<a name="l156"></a>create extern class{} entries.  That's lazy.
<a name="l157"></a>

<a name="l160"></a>Those traverse all the Class, Function and #Define structures.

<a name="l628"></a>Here's how you do it.
<a name="l629"></a>
<a name="l630"></a>Make an offering to God -- praise, hymn, poem, comic, or delightful 
<a name="l631"></a>conversation.  Then, get a response and make it fit the context you established 
<a name="l632"></a>just before.  You don't have to use just the Bible.  You frequently find meaning 
<a name="l633"></a>in proper nouns.  Sometimes, brutally manging the original in a funny way is the 
<a name="l634"></a>obvious answer.
<a name="l635"></a>
<a name="l636"></a>Jews are on my shit-list -- they don't like my operating system with their 
<a name="l637"></a>absurd and viscious security adgenda.  I saw one hideous Jew doing some 
<a name="l638"></a>seciurity-related large scale data-mining project -- disgusted me.  I get 
<a name="l639"></a>disgusted by Jews obviously obsessed with Israel -- not American, not 
<a name="l640"></a>charitible.  All of them walk around and view the world like cornered animals.
<a name="l641"></a>
<a name="l642"></a>It's kinda like this: &quot;To those who have, more will be given; to those who have 
<a name="l643"></a>not, what little they have will be taken away.&quot;  It's one of those ironies that 
<a name="l644"></a>cowardly Jews who do sneaky shit and obsess on security cause their own 
<a name="l645"></a>downfall.
<a name="l646"></a>
<a name="l647"></a>The Brits and CIA and Jews and shit like to ruin my reputation before man -- 
<a name="l648"></a>extorting and shit.  Extortion is a very Jewsish thing.  I crack-up laughing 
<a name="l649"></a>because they are not paying attention to God's opinion.  God did fucken 
<a name="l650"></a>holocaust you.  In the Bible the Jews said, &quot;Gee, we fucked up.&quot;  Ya think!!!?
<a name="l651"></a>
<a name="l652"></a>God said He wanted to &quot;compact&quot; the Jews with the holocaust.  On Arabs and Jews 
<a name="l653"></a>He said &quot;Oil funny, hopefully.&quot;  Jews covet and God fucks with their ugly sense 
<a name="l654"></a>of injustice.  All the Jews run around with a really ugly attitude, &quot;Those Arabs 
<a name="l655"></a>don't deserve that oil for doing nothing.&quot;  God thinks that's funny.
<a name="l656"></a>
<a name="l657"></a>Jesus did some parables that kinda fuck with sense of self-righteous justice.

<a name="l1259"></a>
<a name="l1260"></a>I straddle old and new.  I will tell old people things they need to know.
<a name="l1261"></a>
<a name="l1262"></a>1) When you do assembly language on a modern machine.  It is completely 
<a name="l1263"></a>clusterfucked when you try to estimate timings.  If you write a simple loop to 
<a name="l1264"></a>time an instruction and subtract the loop overhead, you will get a negative time 
<a name="l1265"></a>for that instruction.  You will soon learn execution time is related to cache 
<a name="l1266"></a>hits and misses more then old-school hand crafted asm instructions.  The rule of 
<a name="l1267"></a>thumb -- count memory fetches in the instruction, will not help you.  I have 
<a name="l1268"></a>seen memory indexed loops just as fast as reg -- voodoo cleverness by the CPU.  
<a name="l1269"></a>CISC instructions get converted to RISC and optimized and scheduled by the CPU.  
<a name="l1270"></a>This is very weird when doing a compiler -- discouraging.
<a name="l1271"></a>
<a name="l1272"></a>2) You are horribly Jedi-mind tricked.  I'll bet it never would occur to you 
<a name="l1273"></a>that UTF32 should be used in place of ASCII through-out the entire tool chain.
<a name="l1274"></a>
<a name="l1275"></a>3) You have linux on the brain, a main frame operating system.  This should be 
<a name="l1276"></a>shocking -- there is no reason for virtual (disk swapped) memory.
<a name="l1277"></a>
<a name="l1278"></a>4) Hardware has DMA buffers.  You could live without interrupts.  Just poll 
<a name="l1279"></a>every milisecond.
<a name="l1280"></a>
<a name="l1281"></a>5) Everybody assumes drivers are good.  What good is a three button mouse?  It 
<a name="l1282"></a>is like a bad leg you cannot put your weight on.  What good is surround sound 
<a name="l1283"></a>support?
<a name="l1284"></a>
<a name="l1285"></a>6) Every other engineer operates between over engineering and under engineering. 
<a name="l1286"></a> A software engineer has absolutely no concept of overengineering.  He goes to 
<a name="l1287"></a>his boss who asked for an airplane wing and says, &quot;I made it ten times stronger 
<a name="l1288"></a>than you asked in case we have to change the engine.&quot;  His boss is pleased.  
<a name="l1289"></a>Everybody praises His skill.  More complicated is better because noone want to 
<a name="l1290"></a>look dumb.  Fucken look at the disgusting shit known as USB!  They have branched 
<a name="l1291"></a>networks off each port and they do not allow generic terminal communication 
<a name="l1292"></a>which could handle any issue much better.  You cannot use Hyperterm with a USB 
<a name="l1293"></a>device.
<a name="l1294"></a>
<a name="l1295"></a>6) Coming down the road, we might see nonvolitile memory as the only memory.  
<a name="l1296"></a>You might want byte addressing for what used to be hard drive.  Today, we load a 
<a name="l1297"></a>disk block data and transform it into a memory structure.  We have serialize and 
<a name="l1298"></a>deserialize.  What if just Mallocs for disk and puts it all over the place in 
<a name="l1299"></a>unserialized structures?  That could certainly be a revolution.
