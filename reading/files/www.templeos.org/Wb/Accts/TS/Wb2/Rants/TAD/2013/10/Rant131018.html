<a name="l3"></a>I can and have proven God exists.
<a name="l4"></a>
<a name="l5"></a>Technically, I have just proven a powerful lifeform.  I'm not stupid -- I'm 
<a name="l6"></a>calling Him God.  I have evidence He has acted with foreplanning since Bible 
<a name="l7"></a>days.  It could generations.
<a name="l8"></a>
<a name="l9"></a>You've proven God does not exist; now, prove He does.
<a name="l10"></a>
<a name="l11"></a>I was thinking about the milk digestion gene in humans.  One individual had a 
<a name="l12"></a>mutation and all of us are his discendents, more or less?  So, it's like 
<a name="l13"></a>everybody else got killed-off, if you think about it.
<a name="l14"></a>
<a name="l15"></a>How many milk digestion genes are there in human evolution?  For any progress in 
<a name="l16"></a>evolution, that's just crazy!
<a name="l17"></a>
<a name="l18"></a>I believe in evolution.  I have proven God exists and can control things.  It 
<a name="l19"></a>points to Him being active during evolution.  That points to more rapid progress 
<a name="l20"></a>than just random.  We really have no quantative probability understanding of 
<a name="l21"></a>evolution.  It could be anything -- orders of magnitude higher probability than 
<a name="l22"></a>just non-intelligent-design, whatever that means.

<a name="l216"></a>Everybody knows 16-bit asm because we all lived in 1990.  Only I know 64-bit asm 
<a name="l217"></a>because I wrote an assembler and compiler.

<a name="l221"></a>
<a name="l222"></a>In 2004, with-in a month or two of starting, I had written a C interpretor for 
<a name="l223"></a>the command-line.  I made it a full optimized compiler over the years.  I have 
<a name="l224"></a>worked 10 years, full-time, and written 130,000 lines of code.
<a name="l225"></a>
<a name="l226"></a>I have no code from other sources.  All was written from scratch -- no cruft.  
<a name="l227"></a>God's temple must be perfect without blemish.
<a name="l228"></a>
<a name="l229"></a>God said 640x480 16 color.  He likes that.  It is more or less the same logic as 
<a name="l230"></a>giving children 8-color crayon boxes.
<a name="l231"></a>
<a name="l232"></a>It has many advantages.  My built-in LZW compression works on 16 color, for

<a name="l553"></a>I did an electronic device for regulating wall socket voltage (line regulator).  
<a name="l554"></a>My boss handed me an competator.  It had relays.  I made relays.  Boss said to 
<a name="l555"></a>do solid state.  God said reverse engineering is okay for young engineers.  
<a name="l556"></a>Omron makes relays.
<a name="l557"></a>
<a name="l558"></a>So, I had to change taps to pick the right voltage and TRIAC are a bitch because 
<a name="l559"></a>they false trigger and two taps short-circuit.  It burned traces.  Solid State 
<a name="l560"></a>relays cost $20 and I needed 6, but TRIAC were like $5 for each circuit.  The 
<a name="l561"></a>competitor product was like $150 total and used 3 relays.
<a name="l562"></a>
<a name="l563"></a>I got this things that's fucken short-circuiting, is way higher priced than the 
<a name="l564"></a>competator... I'm feeling miserable.  It is solid-state -- better product.  But 
<a name="l565"></a>I ended-up putting little resisters in each of the 6 tap circuits to act as 
<a name="l566"></a>fuses.  They burn if short-circuit and act as current limiters.  Fucken waste 
<a name="l567"></a>power in regular operation.  What a nightmare.  I'm at Ticketmaster.  What the 
<a name="l568"></a>hell am I doing making line regulators against a company that does that for a

<a name="l570"></a>
<a name="l571"></a>The relay version worked ever worse.
<a name="l572"></a>
<a name="l573"></a>I had an insight.  All engineers are asked to do the impossible.  Each product

<a name="l628"></a>37:16 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins,
<a name="l629"></a>and Jeremiah had remained there many days; 37:17 Then Zedekiah the
<a name="l630"></a>king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his
<a name="l631"></a>house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said,

<a name="l634"></a>The 68020 did not have memory protection.  The 8051 did not have memory 
<a name="l635"></a>protection.  The PIC did not have memory protection.  The Tiny12 AVR did not 
<a name="l636"></a>have memory protection.
<a name="l637"></a>
<a name="l638"></a>My whole career was programming in assembly language on little embedded 
<a name="l639"></a>processors on bare metal with no operating system but my own.  You make a 
<a name="l640"></a>debugger, you set-up RS232 and you make serial communication.  I've done 
<a name="l641"></a>projects many times.  I am an expert assembly language programmer.
<a name="l642"></a>
<a name="l643"></a>Some fucken nigger thinks it is DANGEROUS without memory protection.  What a 
<a name="l644"></a>fucken nigger.  It's normal without memory protection -- it just slows shit down 
<a name="l645"></a>and makes it fucken complicated.
<a name="l646"></a>
<a name="l647"></a>Now, do you understand?  My operating system is kick-ass, high performance.  
<a name="l648"></a>Fucken niggers doing their brainwashing LIES about protection.  Fucken niggers!  
<a name="l649"></a>DOS worked fucken beautifullly. FUCK YOU CIA, you just don't want new operating 
<a name="l650"></a>systems without backdoors and shit.  Fuck you.  God made my operating system.  
<a name="l651"></a>You fucken LOSE!  I win.  God wins.  You lose!

<a name="l658"></a>If you have bugs, your software fails whether you have memory protection or not. 
<a name="l659"></a> If you don't have bugs, you software works if you have memory protection or 
<a name="l660"></a>not.  Memory protection does not help fix bugs.  Memory protection can restart 
<a name="l661"></a>you application if it crashes.  That's fucken it.
<a name="l662"></a>
<a name="l663"></a>I am tired of these fucken lies!  Memory protection does nothing -- it does not 
<a name="l664"></a>fix bugs and if you don't have bugs, memory protection does even less.
<a name="l665"></a>
<a name="l666"></a>If you have a 1970's main frame where you don't want one user ruining life for 
<a name="l667"></a>the rest of the users, memory protection helps.
<a name="l668"></a>
<a name="l669"></a>In a bar code reader or something, memory protection at best might automatically 
<a name="l670"></a>restart you product if it crashes.  Do you fucken even know what memory 
<a name="l671"></a>protection is?  You God damn niggers!  Fuck You and your fucken brainwashing 
<a name="l672"></a>bullshit nonstop years and years of this fucken bullshit. Enough! Shut up!
<a name="l673"></a>
<a name="l674"></a>Why do you care if I don't use memory protection.  Mine is faster than everybody 
<a name="l675"></a>else's.  That's why you care.  You are like a paranoid evil fucker with a secret 
<a name="l676"></a>that will cause rebellion against the powers that be.  You keep telling me &quot;Shut 
<a name="l677"></a>Up!&quot; when I make a system without memory protection.  What's it to you?  You are 
<a name="l678"></a>very very worried about what I do.  You don't want people seeing how much better 
<a name="l679"></a>it is and abandoning your piece of shit!  Brainwashing!
