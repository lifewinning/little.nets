<a name="l2"></a>
<a name="l3"></a>So, we should study the Bible to see what policy applied to offerings.
<a name="l4"></a>
<a name="l5"></a></span><span class=cF2>16:16 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD
<a name="l6"></a>thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened
<a name="l7"></a>bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and
<a name="l8"></a>they shall not appear before the LORD empty: 16:17 Every man shall
<a name="l9"></a>give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God
<a name="l10"></a>which he hath given thee.</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l11"></a>
<a name="l12"></a>Would You like that, God?
<a name="l13"></a>
<a name="l14"></a>God says...
<a name="l15"></a></span><span class=cF4>21:17 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.
<a name="l16"></a>
<a name="l17"></a>21:18 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
<a name="l18"></a>
<a name="l19"></a>21:19 In your patience possess ye your souls.
<a name="l20"></a>
<a name="l21"></a>21:20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know
<a name="l22"></a>that the desolation thereof is nigh.
<a name="l23"></a>
<a name="l24"></a>21:21 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let
<a name="l25"></a>them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that
<a name="l26"></a>are in the countries enter thereinto.
<a name="l27"></a>
<a name="l28"></a>21:22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
<a name="l29"></a>written may be fulfilled.
<a name="l30"></a>
<a name="l31"></a>21:23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
<a name="l32"></a>suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land,
<a name="l33"></a>and wrath upon this people.</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l34"></a>
<a name="l35"></a>I think if You talked, nobody would complain.
<a name="l36"></a>
<a name="l37"></a>God says...

<a name="l40"></a>----11/29/13 23:42:41----
<a name="l41"></a>
<a name="l42"></a>I was going to praise God for pirates (1700/1800's).  Ships could be intercepted 
<a name="l43"></a>and... ships break-up on rocks... and some people decided to be bad guys... and 
<a name="l44"></a>parrots.  (I have birds.)  Pirates of the Carrabean appeals to me as a fantasy 
<a name="l45"></a>setting -- what a rich Creation God made.
<a name="l46"></a>
<a name="l47"></a>God says...
<a name="l48"></a></span><span class=cF4>19:13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
<a name="l49"></a>our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that
<a name="l50"></a>which is good in his sight.
<a name="l51"></a>
<a name="l52"></a>19:14 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
<a name="l53"></a>Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
<a name="l54"></a>
<a name="l55"></a>19:15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
<a name="l56"></a>they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the
<a name="l57"></a>city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
<a name="l58"></a>
<a name="l59"></a>19:16 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before
<a name="l60"></a>Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were
<a name="l61"></a>beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer
<a name="l62"></a>went before them.
<a name="l63"></a>
<a name="l64"></a>19:17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed
<a name="l65"></a>over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against
<a name="l66"></a>them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians,
<a name="l67"></a>they fought with him.</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l68"></a>
<a name="l69"></a>No, that's okay.  Somebody else can go enjoy fantasies in Syria.  :-)

<a name="l72"></a>
<a name="l73"></a>Some people drive a long way to go fight there.  I wonder if Syria had Russian 
<a name="l74"></a>advisors.  That would be classic.
<a name="l75"></a>
<a name="l76"></a>Nevermind.
<a name="l77"></a>
<a name="l78"></a>Do You think we'll have fewer wars because we have better entertainment?
<a name="l79"></a>
<a name="l80"></a>God says...
<a name="l81"></a></span><span class=cF4>but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
<a name="l82"></a>
<a name="l83"></a>6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
<a name="l84"></a>obey it in the lusts thereof.
<a name="l85"></a>
<a name="l86"></a>6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness
<a name="l87"></a>unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from
<a name="l88"></a>the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
<a name="l89"></a>
<a name="l90"></a>6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
<a name="l91"></a>the law, but under grace.
<a name="l92"></a>
<a name="l93"></a>6:15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but
<a name="l94"></a>under grace? God forbid.
<a name="l95"></a>
<a name="l96"></a>6:16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey,
<a name="l97"></a>his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of
<a name="l98"></a>obedience unto righteousness?  6:17 But God be thanked, that ye were
<a name="l99"></a>the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of
<a name="l100"></a>doctrine which was delivered you.</span><span class=cF0>
