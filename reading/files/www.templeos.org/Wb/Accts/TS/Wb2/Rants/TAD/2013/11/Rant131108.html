<a name="l1148"></a>When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system,

<a name="l1150"></a>
<a name="l1151"></a>1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is 
<a name="l1152"></a>present.
<a name="l1153"></a>
<a name="l1154"></a>2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  
<a name="l1155"></a>Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished code.)  
<a name="l1156"></a>
<a name="l1157"></a>3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
<a name="l1158"></a>option, so CD/DVD is what we use.
<a name="l1159"></a>
<a name="l1160"></a>4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used 
<a name="l1161"></a>along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.
<a name="l1162"></a>
<a name="l1163"></a>5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.
<a name="l1164"></a>
<a name="l1165"></a>6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.
<a name="l1166"></a>
<a name="l1167"></a>7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.
<a name="l1168"></a>
<a name="l1169"></a>8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing 
<a name="l1170"></a>for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.
<a name="l1171"></a>
<a name="l1172"></a>9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating 
<a name="l1173"></a>systems.
<a name="l1174"></a>
<a name="l1175"></a>10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS .GRA graphics files.
<a name="l1176"></a>
<a name="l1177"></a>In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as 
<a name="l1178"></a>a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.
<a name="l1179"></a>
<a name="l1180"></a>It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
<a name="l1181"></a>will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
<a name="l1182"></a>Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.
<a name="l1183"></a>
<a name="l1184"></a>I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
<a name="l1185"></a>propriatary graphics formats.
<a name="l1186"></a>
