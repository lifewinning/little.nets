<a name="l3"></a>I used to write to Bush.  I told him how much I admired people who made the 
<a name="l4"></a>commitment and bought homes instead of renting, how this was the American Dream,

<a name="l7"></a>One lesson is, &quot;don't be proud of heart.&quot;  You can break your arm patting 
<a name="l8"></a>yourself on the back for what a good liberal you are.  Just pray it is not your 
<a name="l9"></a>decisions that are acted on.  The military is one place where we don't follow 
<a name="l10"></a>liberal lies.

<a name="l12"></a>Home ownership is bad for people relocating to find work.

<a name="l15"></a>expectant joy.  They get the same joy as people playing the lottery -- hope for

<a name="l474"></a>I have a good way to explain why God wants 640x480 16 color.  Suppose you are 
<a name="l475"></a>making a game with an elephant.  If I gave you 24-bits of color, you would have 
<a name="l476"></a>to make a gradient for all the cylinders in this drawing:

<a name="l479"></a>
<a name="l480"></a>By giving you just 4-bits of color, you have a good excuse for making a ghetto 
<a name="l481"></a>elephant.  You didn't want to spend all that effort on nice graphics.  If you 
<a name="l482"></a>are doing recreational programming, you don't want to spend so much time 
<a name="l483"></a>toiling-away on nice graphics.  A 16 color elephant for a game might take 10

<a name="l604"></a>raise up seed unto his brother.
<a name="l605"></a>
<a name="l606"></a>22:25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
<a name="l607"></a>had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto
<a name="l608"></a>his brother: 22:26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the
<a name="l609"></a>seventh.
<a name="l610"></a>
