<a name="l1619"></a>When I was 12, I babysat Kevin's kids.  I thought being a professional

<a name="l1621"></a>just being a professional.
<a name="l1622"></a>
<a name="l1623"></a>In 1990, I bought a camera for a trip to the northwest.  I took photos of 
<a name="l1624"></a>Kevin's kids.  Ryan has his shirt off and Kim looks... slutty?  Dad really liked 
<a name="l1625"></a>the pictures.  I tried to throw them away because I'm superstitious on anything 
<a name="l1626"></a>from my past.  In 1996 I gave away everything, like Jesus said to be perfect.  
<a name="l1627"></a>Dad started grabbing shit to save.  I want to be perfect like Jesus said.  Dad 
<a name="l1628"></a>is a pedophile and he figured he could use the Kim photos against me.  They're
