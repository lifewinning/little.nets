<a name="l3"></a>I used to suffer from nightmares.  Yeah, sometimes the news (which intentionally 
<a name="l4"></a>hypes headlines to make them scary) would give me nightmares.  Often, I would 
<a name="l5"></a>dwell on dark topic, like the Holocaust and evolution.
<a name="l6"></a>
<a name="l7"></a>Peter Gadwa said that often an outsider can look at a person and say, &quot;Your 
<a name="l8"></a>problem is obvious!&quot;
<a name="l9"></a>
<a name="l10"></a>Anyway, occassionally, you'll see a person who obesses on dark topics.  It's 
<a name="l11"></a>very profound that you can choose to dwell on happy stuff.  Stay &quot;in the light&quot;, 
<a name="l12"></a>unless you like nightmares. LOL

<a name="l42"></a>When you go through the ten commandments, a commandment to honor God's name, 
<a name="l43"></a>seems strange.  I decided I honored it by capitalizing pronouns referring to 
<a name="l44"></a>God.  The point of the first few commandments is to love God.  It makes me happy

<a name="l78"></a>fails, we like to take pleasure.  Communism seems morally bankrupt.  Thou shall 
<a name="l79"></a>not covet.  It does not seem noble to want to rob the rich, that seems low class 
<a name="l80"></a>and not admirable.  Socialism makes you think of lazy workers.

<a name="l1894"></a>hrow</span><span class=cF0> is a function with var (&quot;</span><span class=cF2>...</span><span class=cF0>&quot;) args.  The values passed in </span><span class=cF2>throw()</span><span class=cF0> can be 
<a name="l1895"></a>accessed from within a </span><span class=cF2>catch{}</span><span class=cF0> using the </span><span class=cF2>Fs-&gt;except_argc</span><span class=cF0> and </span><span class=cF2>Fs-&gt;except_argv[]</span><span class=cF0>

<a name="l1898"></a>rgv[]</span><span class=cF0> specifies the exception type num.  A list of assigned exception types can 
<a name="l1899"></a>be found at .  For a handler that will catch all excepts, you can use </span><a href="../../../../../../../Kernel/Except.html#l46"><span class=cF4>PutExcept</span></a><span class=cF0>(

<a name="l1902"></a>* A function is available similar to </span><span class=cF2>sizeof</span><span class=cF0> which provides the offset of a 
<a name="l1903"></a>member of a class.  It's called </span><span class=cF2>offset</span><span class=cF0>.  You place the class name and member 
<a name="l1904"></a>inside as in </span><span class=cF2>offset(classname.membername)</span><span class=cF0>.  It has nothing to do with 16-bit 
<a name="l1905"></a>code.  Both </span><span class=cF2>sizeof</span><span class=cF0> and </span><span class=cF2>offset</span><span class=cF0> only accept one level of member vars.  That is, 
<a name="l1906"></a>you can't do </span><span class=cF2>sizeof(classname.membername.submembername)</span><span class=cF0>.
<a name="l1907"></a>
<a name="l1908"></a>* There is no </span><span class=cF2>continue</span><span class=cF0> statement.  Use </span><span class=cF2>goto</span><span class=cF0>.

<a name="l1917"></a>* There is a function called </span><a href="../../../../../../../Kernel/Mem1b.html#l370"><span class=cF4>MSize</span></a><span class=cF0>() which gives the size of an object allocated 
<a name="l1918"></a>off the heap.  For larger size allocations, the system rounds-up to a power of 
<a name="l1919"></a>two, so </span><span class=cF2>MSize()</span><span class=cF0> lets you know the real size and you can take full advantage of

<a name="l1925"></a>
<a name="l1926"></a>* The stk does not grow because virtual mem is not used.  I recommend allocating

You can use </span><a href="../../../../../../../Kernel/Task1a.html#l87"><span class=cF4>CallStkGrow</span></a><span class=cF0>(), but it's odd.
