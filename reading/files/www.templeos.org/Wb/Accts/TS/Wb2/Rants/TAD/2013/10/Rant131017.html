<a name="l1002"></a>Peter Gadwa put MasterMind onto the Ticketmaster system.
<a name="l1003"></a>
<a name="l1004"></a>MasterMind is a logic game where you try to make the minumum number of guesses.
<a name="l1005"></a>
<a name="l1006"></a>I assume Pete thought MasterMind was debugging.
<a name="l1007"></a>
<a name="l1008"></a>Debugging is not MasterMind scored by number of guesses, but scored on a time 
<a name="l1009"></a>clock.
<a name="l1010"></a>
<a name="l1011"></a>In programming, when you guess thoughtlessly, however, it is likely you are 
<a name="l1012"></a>stupid and making bugs.
<a name="l1013"></a>
<a name="l1014"></a>Thinking hard is painful like lifting weights.  Often, you can get by, avoiding 
<a name="l1015"></a>thinking hard.  My operating system is navigated by keyboard, but when you are 
<a name="l1016"></a>using cursor keys, it is painless compared to the pain of typing words.
<a name="l1017"></a>
<a name="l1018"></a>If you can minimize the turn-around time for testing code, it is strategically 
<a name="l1019"></a>important.
<a name="l1020"></a>
<a name="l1021"></a>It's true that you can guess a math sign in one guess, or guess true/false in 
<a name="l1022"></a>one guess.  It's more painless to guess than think.  Yeah, this might be how 
<a name="l1023"></a>bugs are born, frequently -- getting sloppy and lazy.
<a name="l1024"></a>
<a name="l1025"></a>Judge me by my work and the quality of my code.  I wrote 130,000 lines over ten 
<a name="l1026"></a>years.  I often employ strategy in place of tactics.  I am creative.  My 
<a name="l1027"></a>solutions are elegant and tiny.  My operating system is very responsive.  I have 
<a name="l1028"></a>divine intellect.

<a name="l1075"></a>Someone suggested putting &quot;interrupt&quot; and &quot;argpop&quot; and &quot;noargpop&quot;, function 
<a name="l1076"></a>attributes into a more generic structure.  Planning for future growth is 
<a name="l1077"></a>instinctive for programmers, but I am now in a completion mindset -- rarely do 
<a name="l1078"></a>programmers experience this.
<a name="l1079"></a>
<a name="l1080"></a>It's limited to 100,000 lines forever!  I have been shortening labels.  
<a name="l1081"></a>&quot;GetDateTime()&quot; is &quot;Now()&quot;.  At this point, I am moving in the other direction 
<a name="l1082"></a>from planning for growth to the direction of nipping short.
<a name="l1083"></a>
<a name="l1084"></a>Do you know how early BASIC programs had short labels like &quot;Now()&quot; for time?  
<a name="l1085"></a>They are delightful.

<a name="l1102"></a>dawned on me that Root was not such a good name!  I changed it to &quot;Adam&quot;.  The 
<a name="l1103"></a>moral is, there are many times when a new name is best.  If you use an old name 
<a name="l1104"></a>for something, similar but not the same, you might be doing a disservice.
