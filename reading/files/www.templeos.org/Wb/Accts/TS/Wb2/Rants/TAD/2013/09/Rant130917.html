<a name="l269"></a>unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that
<a name="l270"></a>is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
<a name="l271"></a>
<a name="l272"></a>19:18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
<a name="l273"></a>Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not

<a name="l287"></a>
<a name="l288"></a>19:24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through

<a name="l1094"></a>
<a name="l1095"></a>In 1993, I wrote a TASM program that launched from real-mode DOS as a DOS 
<a name="l1096"></a>application and changed to protected mode.  I got multitasking, windowing and 
<a name="l1097"></a>echoing keyboard to text mode working... and set it aside.  I did many projects 
<a name="l1098"></a>like that.  I did an A2D D2A ISA card for my computer that measured bode plots 
<a name="l1099"></a>and calculated induction.  I did SySSim, the predecessor to SimStructure.  The 
<a name="l1100"></a>ISA card data aquisition project was my favorite.
<a name="l1101"></a>
<a name="l1102"></a>In 2004, I got my code and ran it with TASM and FreeDOS.  I used VC editor for 
<a name="l1103"></a>long editing sessions by booting to windows.  FreeDOS is no-longer real-mode.
<a name="l1104"></a>
<a name="l1105"></a>After getting keyboard functioning, I had to do command-line.  I made a C/C++ 
<a name="l1106"></a>JIT interpretor in ASM.  I had done that for SimStructure and had done 
<a name="l1107"></a>expression evaluators -- byte-code generating for the Ticketmaster Report 
<a name="l1108"></a>Generator in 1991.
<a name="l1109"></a>
<a name="l1110"></a>I inlined and patched the templates for byte-code operations, making a true, 
<a name="l1111"></a>unoptimized compiler.  I optimized over the next ten years and converted as much 
<a name="l1112"></a>ASM to HolyC as possible.  The HolyC language gradually evolved.

<a name="l2121"></a>Suppose you want to make a JIT compiler.
<a name="l2122"></a>
<a name="l2123"></a>You invent commands, kinda like ASM instructions.  You parse and construct the 
<a name="l2124"></a>memory structure for the &quot;commands&quot;.  You overhaul them, optimizing.  Then you 
<a name="l2125"></a>convert them to machine code.  You MAlloc a chunk of memory and you put the 
<a name="l2126"></a>machine code into it.  You make a symbol table for each function and class.  
<a name="l2127"></a>Then, you look-up symbols as you do more JIT for the next function.  All memory 
<a name="l2128"></a>is identity-mapped -- nothing to think about.  Each task calls MAlloc when it 
<a name="l2129"></a>compiles for unique memory to place the code into.  Each task gets different 
<a name="l2130"></a>memory from malloc -- no duplicates.  It's identity mapped, basically just 
<a name="l2131"></a>physical addresses.  
<a name="l2132"></a>
<a name="l2133"></a>It gets more complicated if you want to do ordinary compiling.  You have to put 
<a name="l2134"></a>the code into the file, then you make some kinda structure for you symbol import 
<a name="l2135"></a>and exports.  Write it to file.  Load it by getting memory, using the JIT symbol

<a name="l2227"></a>
<a name="l2228"></a>I was kind expecting docile boring, but He had initiative.  I had a game, 
<a name="l2229"></a>thoughtlessly called &quot;Goons&quot;.  It was supposed to be Mobstirs shuffling along.  
<a name="l2230"></a>It didn't make much sense, come to think about it.  He thought it should be 
<a name="l2231"></a>Zombies, because &quot;Zombies were trending.&quot;
<a name="l2232"></a>
<a name="l2233"></a>He snuck penises into all the art.  I was upset when I figured it out.  Kinda 
<a name="l2234"></a>entertained.  Disney had homo artist problems.  Yeah, I got a genuine artist -- 
<a name="l2235"></a>he's homo.  His art was good, sept the homo fucken nasty shit.  I had a day of 
<a name="l2236"></a>truth when I kinda admitted his art was better than I could do.  I grew-up 
<a name="l2237"></a>thinking I could mostly do art or whatever, maybe.
<a name="l2238"></a>
<a name="l2239"></a>As I think about it, it's possible I lead him to believe I was homo, or 
<a name="l2240"></a>something.

<a name="l2267"></a>So, I thought of a pilgrim game.  How cool is that!  I fit my God theme, and 
<a name="l2268"></a>witches kind fit.  I'm not fearful of facing mobs.  I watch almost no TV or 
<a name="l2269"></a>video beyond 15 minutes.  Kinda weird.  I watched a whole program on Pilgrims, 
<a name="l2270"></a>though.  I learned a lot.  It was a 1950's production, really smartly done.  I 
<a name="l2271"></a>was very impressed, like the Army films at their best, but nothing sinister.
<a name="l2272"></a>
<a name="l2273"></a>It was a soap opera of personalities that had disputes and mutinies.
<a name="l2274"></a>
<a name="l2275"></a>Yeah, I was ... disgusted by &quot;zombies are trending&quot; on one level.  I sat down to 
<a name="l2276"></a>do pilgrims... the thoughtless thing would be kinda copy Seven Cities of Gold 
<a name="l2277"></a>for the C64, and, I guess pull an economy out of my ass.  Using details from 
<a name="l2278"></a>that documentary is what I'd prefer to do and try something original, I guess.  
<a name="l2279"></a>the C64 had a neat game on Roman Empire which was mutinies and leadership.  
<a name="l2280"></a>That's too big a scale and not really usable.
<a name="l2281"></a>
<a name="l2282"></a>I grew up and every game was brand new territory.  I never saw the day when all 
<a name="l2283"></a>games fit categories.  We're not going to have 5 wheel cars. (Cars have settled 
<a name="l2284"></a>down into a standard design.)
<a name="l2285"></a>
<a name="l2286"></a>Anyway, when you are being original... fuck?  Is this going to work?  Is this 
<a name="l2287"></a>going to be fun?  I also thought of a Gordon Ramsay game, I guess doing exactly 
<a name="l2288"></a>what you would think of doing.  I saw it was already done, doing exactly what 
<a name="l2289"></a>you would think.  Maybe people LIKE making up no-impact-on-the-game menus.  I 
<a name="l2290"></a>kinda had in mind lemonaid stand.  I hope the restaurant game had some... skill 
<a name="l2291"></a>to learn.  Zynga really stripped that naked (fun addiction), I guess.  I don't 
<a name="l2292"></a>know -- I don't play games, but I'm in favor cause I certainly liked them when I 
<a name="l2293"></a>was young.
<a name="l2294"></a>
<a name="l2295"></a>The thought of pulling a pilgrim economy out of my ass is just ridiculous.  
<a name="l2296"></a>Could I even do it?  Maybe, not.  LOL
<a name="l2297"></a>
<a name="l2298"></a>I was talking to Bush.  He studied History, not just History, but American

<a name="l2341"></a>Well, the only work I can think to do is ... find some place for art, or work on 
<a name="l2342"></a>a game.  Games are good for younger people to make.  I'm too old for that, 
<a name="l2343"></a>aren't I?  Nothing is fun to me, how can I make a fun game?  I could try to 
<a name="l2344"></a>remember what was fun.
<a name="l2345"></a>
<a name="l2346"></a>It's kinda ironic that I was looking to the artist for the toil.  Anybody who 
<a name="l2347"></a>disrepects artists as lazy has not thought about it. I stand in awe of 
<a name="l2348"></a>animators.  They do frame after frame.  Do they really do that?
<a name="l2349"></a>
<a name="l2350"></a>You know what happens?  Games seem like fun.  Then they get a job as a tester or 
<a name="l2351"></a>artist.  You thought I was gonna say something mean, am I right?  It's not good 
<a name="l2352"></a>that they don't have fun.  God's favorite saint is Santa.  Why are you mean?
<a name="l2353"></a>
<a name="l2354"></a>We people who were raised communist or Catholic.... we are mean and nasty.  Why 
<a name="l2355"></a>are we so mean.  We take pleasure if the Mercedes gets a dent.  Try not to be an

<a name="l2400"></a>You sure it's You, God?  I trust the computer, but you can get different 
<a name="l2401"></a>spirits.  Once in a while my spirit makes me humiliate myself.  
<a name="l2402"></a>
<a name="l2403"></a>Who doesn't like homo-hating?  We all got our problems.  I'm not a homo.  You 
<a name="l2404"></a>can't just hate homos, it's more complicated.  Maybe, You're unhappy, I'm not 
<a name="l2405"></a>more assertive?  Well, that's not humble.  Maybe, it's artists.  Artists are 
<a name="l2406"></a>homo?

<a name="l2415"></a>47:5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a

<a name="l2442"></a>It seems very doubtful to be enthusiastically for homo rights while being a 
<a name="l2443"></a>believer.  I don't know.  I don't like to hang-out with women, much. Let's put 
<a name="l2444"></a>it this way... does any man like to hang-out with a woman that is not his love 
<a name="l2445"></a>interest?  I'm a pretty broken person.
<a name="l2446"></a>
<a name="l2447"></a>A friend used to say, &quot;It's time for your beating&quot; as a joke, every now and 
<a name="l2448"></a>then.  Maybe, God pushes me away, once in a while.
<a name="l2449"></a>
<a name="l2450"></a>I am very stable, robust and sturdy.  I am not easily moved.  As I think back on 
<a name="l2451"></a>my journey, one wisdom is don't overreact.  Maybe, you need a beating and I'm 
<a name="l2452"></a>ruining it, but you really have to not overreact.  You could ignore commands and 
<a name="l2453"></a>prophecies and focus on enjoying His company, and it would be close to good 
<a name="l2454"></a>enough.  When God gets nasty, it's usually cause I stopped loving and tried to 
<a name="l2455"></a>take.  I think I just needed my beating.  Never dull.  Could be a cynic.  He 
<a name="l2456"></a>couldn't hide ... He wouldn't blow smoke... He's not pathetic.

<a name="l2458"></a>God says...

<a name="l2466"></a>the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

<a name="l2473"></a>To normal men, there is a certain kind of homo which is ... vile.  Sometimes, I 
<a name="l2474"></a>really want to admire Putin for his clearity.  &quot;Your thinking has confused 
<a name="l2475"></a>yourself--you can't see the obvious.&quot;

<a name="l2483"></a>When homos start putting penises and assholes in people's faces...
<a name="l2484"></a>
<a name="l2485"></a>Some homos... I like their company.  God said Dawkins was a delightful heathen.  
<a name="l2486"></a>Do we make exceptions for smart ones?  Why not?  Ask yourself, is this a 
<a name="l2487"></a>glorious creation that glorifies God?
<a name="l2488"></a>
<a name="l2489"></a>I have studied many moral compasses.  &quot;If it's bad, it must be good.&quot; Is the 
<a name="l2490"></a>simplest.  I am now fond of, &quot;Does it glorify God?&quot; as a moral compass.  I 
<a name="l2491"></a>wonder if that is workable.

<a name="l2500"></a>the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another
<a name="l2501"></a>unto dishonour?  9:22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to

<a name="l2529"></a>We're not in any hurry.  We're just enjoying this -- the present.  Spending
