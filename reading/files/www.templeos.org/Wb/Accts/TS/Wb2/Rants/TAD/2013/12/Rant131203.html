<a name="l633"></a>When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
<a name="l634"></a>publically, here's what I want:
<a name="l635"></a>
<a name="l636"></a>1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is 
<a name="l637"></a>present.
<a name="l638"></a>
<a name="l639"></a>2) Windows and Linux will support </span><a href="../../../../../../../Doc/RedSea.html#l1"><span class=cF4>RedSea</span></a><span class=cF0> file system so I can get rid of 2,000 
<a name="l640"></a>lines of redundant, blemished code -- FAT32 and ISO9660.  God's temple must be

<a name="l646"></a>
<a name="l647"></a>3) Windows must burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
<a name="l648"></a>option, so CD/DVD is what we use.
<a name="l649"></a>
<a name="l650"></a>4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used 
<a name="l651"></a>along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.
<a name="l652"></a>
<a name="l653"></a>5) Mandate to PC hardware manufacturers: ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.
<a name="l654"></a>
<a name="l655"></a>6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.
<a name="l656"></a>
<a name="l657"></a>7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.
<a name="l658"></a>
<a name="l659"></a>8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing 
<a name="l660"></a>for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.
<a name="l661"></a>
<a name="l662"></a>9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the official 64-bit 
<a name="l663"></a>operating systems.
<a name="l664"></a>
<a name="l665"></a>10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS </span><span class=cF2>.GRA</span><span class=cF0> graphics files.  These are 
<a name="l666"></a>just right-side-up </span><span class=cF2>.BMP</span><span class=cF0> files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency,

<a name="l671"></a>
<a name="l672"></a>
<a name="l673"></a>
<a name="l674"></a>In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as 
<a name="l675"></a>a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.
<a name="l676"></a>
<a name="l677"></a>It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
<a name="l678"></a>will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
<a name="l679"></a>Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.

<a name="l830"></a>
<a name="l831"></a>TempleOS is God's official temple.  God said to use 640x480 16 color graphics 
<a name="l832"></a>and God said to have a single audio voice.  That is just like how He specified 
<a name="l833"></a>cubits in the Bible!  He also said it must be perfect.  God needs a temple as a 
<a name="l834"></a>special beloved place where His people, young and old, can do offerings and 
<a name="l835"></a>consult God in the oracle.  Like Solomon's Temple, this is a focal point for the 
<a name="l836"></a>community.  Adults can write hymns, psalms (poems of praise) and meditation 
<a name="l837"></a>essays with good support for links to the Bible.  Like Cain and Abel, do 
<a name="l838"></a>offerings and learn what God likes and doesn't like.
<a name="l839"></a>
<a name="l840"></a>* TempleOS will be limited to 100,000 lines of code, not including applications 
<a name="l841"></a>and demos.  This will ensure it stays out of trouble going a thousand years into 
<a name="l842"></a>the future.  It will not stray much from my vision as long as this is kept.  
<a name="l843"></a>Other, less important, characteristics can be changed but as long as the 100,000 
<a name="l844"></a>line limit is kept, it will stay true. 
<a name="l845"></a> 
<a name="l846"></a>* It must be kept perfect.  </span><span class=cF4>Backward compatibility is NOT guaranteed.</span><span class=cF0>  You are 
<a name="l847"></a>safest working with </span><span class=cF2>JIT</span><span class=cF0> compilation instead of </span><span class=cF2>AOT</span><span class=cF0> binaries because members to 
<a name="l848"></a>classes can be added and reorder, args with defaults can be added to existing 
<a name="l849"></a>functions, changes to </span><span class=cF2>#define</span><span class=cF0> values can be made, all without breaking 
<a name="l850"></a>compatibility.
<a name="l851"></a>
<a name="l852"></a>* TempleOS is </span><span class=cF2>ring-0-only</span><span class=cF0>, running everything in kernel mode including 
<a name="l853"></a>applications.  You have full access to memory, I/O ports, instructions, etc. at 
<a name="l854"></a>all times, because that's fun.  It is simpler and faster, too.
<a name="l855"></a>
<a name="l856"></a>* TempleOS will always </span><span class=cF2>identity-map</span><span class=cF0> memory in a </span><span class=cF2>single-address-map</span><span class=cF0> 
<a name="l857"></a>configuration.  (Virtual addresses are always kept equal to physical addresses 
<a name="l858"></a>with a single map for all tasks on all cores.)  It's as though paging is not 
<a name="l859"></a>used.
<a name="l860"></a>
<a name="l861"></a>* TempleOS will always be for one platform -- </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64"><span class=cF4>x86_64</span></a><span class=cF0> PC compatibles.
<a name="l862"></a>
<a name="l863"></a>* TempleOS will never have networking, so malware is less of an issue.
<a name="l864"></a>
<a name="l865"></a>* TempleOS will always have one video mode, </span><span class=cF2>640x480</span><span class=cF0> by 16 colors, unless that 
<a name="l866"></a>mode becomes unavailable on computers in the future.
<a name="l867"></a>
<a name="l868"></a>* TempleOS will always just have PC Speaker sound.
<a name="l869"></a>
<a name="l870"></a>* TempleOS will always be </span><span class=cF2>free</span><span class=cF0>.  I might sell applications, support, or, 
<a name="l871"></a>possibly, do adware.
<a name="l872"></a>
<a name="l873"></a>* TempleOS will always be </span><span class=cF2>100% open source</span><span class=cF0> with all source included, unless 
<a name="l874"></a>device drivers or something can only be included with non-disclosure agreements.
<a name="l875"></a>
<a name="l876"></a>* All function args and returns will be 64-bit.  No plans for C++.
<a name="l877"></a>
<a name="l878"></a>* TempleOS documents are not for printing.  They're dynamic and intended for the 
<a name="l879"></a>screen.  There will always be just one font, a fixed-width font.  No Unicode, 
<a name="l880"></a>just &quot;8-bit ASCII&quot;.
<a name="l881"></a>
<a name="l882"></a>* TempleOS is not for multimedia.  Games will be created by programmers, not 
<a name="l883"></a>artists.  Sounds and images will be, primarily, calculated in real-time, not

<a name="l901"></a>I like multicore, but single core speed is better, obviously.  Ironically, I'm 
<a name="l902"></a>the only operating system that can use multicore in games.  Games are real-time. 
<a name="l903"></a> SMP means the scheduler moves the tasks to a free CPU.  In a game, you want to 
<a name="l904"></a>assign one task to each core and you certainly don't want the scheduler messing 
<a name="l905"></a>with it.  You need to know how many cores, so you can update one strip of the 
<a name="l906"></a>screen.
<a name="l907"></a>
<a name="l908"></a>I use 6 cores instead of 8 because I am in VMware.  When running my flight 
<a name="l909"></a>simulator, if VMware borrows a core for Windows stuff, suddenly... I assigned 
<a name="l910"></a>1/8th of the screen to each core and a single core gets borrowed...  That's no 
<a name="l911"></a>good!  The screen update is put on hold because 1/8th of the screen has not been 
<a name="l912"></a>drawn!  Instead of 30 fps, I get 15 fps or worse and horrible glitches.
<a name="l913"></a>
<a name="l914"></a>In SMP, they figure 7 cores one cycle and 1 core the next cycle is just the same 
<a name="l915"></a>as 8 cores.  When I am missing 1/8th of the screen being drawn and all put on 
<a name="l916"></a>hold, that is not acceptible.
<a name="l917"></a>
<a name="l918"></a>
<a name="l919"></a>Multicore is fun, when you have low level control -- let the kids play with it.  
<a name="l920"></a>It's fairly difficult to get a net gain.  I don't use a GPU, so I can put 
<a name="l921"></a>multicores to use on updating the screen, fairly easily.
<a name="l922"></a>
<a name="l923"></a>I actually like not using GPU just for the transparency.  It makes multicore 
<a name="l924"></a>neat, too.

<a name="l1179"></a>all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with
<a name="l1180"></a>this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers
<a name="l1181"></a>to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
<a name="l1182"></a>
<a name="l1183"></a>31:8 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with
<a name="l1184"></a>thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither
<a name="l1185"></a>be dismayed.

<a name="l1187"></a>31:9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the

<a name="l1189"></a>all the elders of Israel.

<a name="l1195"></a>Owls? I'll bet you could make owls seem pretty evil.  You could make them not 
<a name="l1196"></a>seem very evil.  Seeming good is a stretch.
<a name="l1197"></a>
<a name="l1198"></a>That brings me to a moral compass I was toying with:  &quot;Does this glorify God?&quot; 
<a name="l1199"></a>God wants praise, but Catholics only thank God.
<a name="l1200"></a>
<a name="l1201"></a>Glorifying God as a moral compass seems like higher moral ground than Catholics 
<a name="l1202"></a>mostly occupy.  It is troubling, perhaps evil in some cases.
