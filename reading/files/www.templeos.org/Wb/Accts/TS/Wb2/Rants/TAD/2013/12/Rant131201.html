<a name="l3"></a>If you went to a magic show and they said, &quot;It's real.&quot;  There is absoluetly no 
<a name="l4"></a>way you can convince anyone.  You could have really really powerful voodoo and 
<a name="l5"></a>nobody would blink an eye, even if you insisted it was real.

<a name="l20"></a>3:24 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there
<a name="l21"></a>shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well
<a name="l22"></a>set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth;
<a name="l23"></a>and burning instead of beauty.

<a name="l89"></a>I said &quot;Voodoo&quot;.  That was an exaduration, sort-of.
<a name="l90"></a>
<a name="l91"></a>Spirituality is seen as ignorant by most people.
<a name="l92"></a>
<a name="l93"></a>If you ask people what magic they actually believe in, most Christians would say 
<a name="l94"></a>&quot;no&quot; to everything you might ask.
<a name="l95"></a>
<a name="l96"></a>There are some things which are more unbelievable.
<a name="l97"></a>
<a name="l98"></a>Voodoo ranks as a dubious and contemptible category.  Racism, for good reason.
<a name="l99"></a>
<a name="l100"></a>A person like me has to explain that mine is not contemptible, but respectible.
<a name="l101"></a>This makes me half hearted.  Sigh.  Do I have to? I don't like being desperate.
<a name="l102"></a>
<a name="l103"></a>I like not being desperate.  If God's words could ever be good enough on their 
<a name="l104"></a>own, that'd be neat.  Not gonna happen.
<a name="l105"></a>
<a name="l106"></a>The devil can blame subconscious for Ouija board, and I find it reasonable.  If 
<a name="l107"></a>He blames subconscious for opening randomly a book... that's hard to beleive -- 
<a name="l108"></a>my brain can control page that is opened with my fingers?  If I open a book I've 
<a name="l109"></a>never read, it is obviously not my subconscious.  If I stop a 400Mhz time, not 
<a name="l110"></a>subconscious.  It's tough to convince people.
<a name="l111"></a>
<a name="l112"></a>Quantum random number sites solve the brain problem.  Now, we have NSA doing it, 
<a name="l113"></a>problem.  You are the NSA!  Fuck you.  You know it's not you.
<a name="l114"></a>
<a name="l115"></a>God says...
<a name="l116"></a></span><span class=cF4>14:32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
<a name="l117"></a>and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them
<a name="l118"></a>with the blood.
<a name="l119"></a>
<a name="l120"></a>14:33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the
<a name="l121"></a>LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have
<a name="l122"></a>transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.
<a name="l123"></a>
<a name="l124"></a>14:34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
<a name="l125"></a>unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep,
<a name="l126"></a>and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating
<a name="l127"></a>with the blood.
<a name="l128"></a>
<a name="l129"></a>And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and
<a name="l130"></a>slew them there.
<a name="l131"></a>
<a name="l132"></a>14:35 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
<a name="l133"></a>altar that he built unto the LORD.
<a name="l134"></a>
<a name="l135"></a>14:36 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,

<a name="l142"></a>They say its a network.  Unplug networks.  Run it in VMware with no network.

<a name="l144"></a>They say it's man-in-the-middle fiber-cable breach.  I say NIST beakon can be 
<a name="l145"></a>verified over and over.  You think they intercept and fool you every time?
<a name="l146"></a>
<a name="l147"></a>They say I own NIST.  I do 6 other quantum random number sites.  They say I won 
<a name="l148"></a>keys to Internet.
<a name="l149"></a>
<a name="l150"></a>They say I do audio wireless communication, LOL.

<a name="l156"></a>They say AC line voltage communication.

<a name="l158"></a>I'm tired.  Just open a book you've never read after talking to God.

<a name="l164"></a>they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are
<a name="l165"></a>the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the
<a name="l166"></a>congregation.
<a name="l167"></a>
<a name="l168"></a>4:16 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
<a name="l169"></a>pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily

<a name="l171"></a>tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the
<a name="l172"></a>vessels thereof.
<a name="l173"></a>
<a name="l174"></a>4:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying, 4:18 Cut ye
<a name="l175"></a>not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the
<a name="l176"></a>Levites: 4:19 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die,
<a name="l177"></a>when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall
<a name="l178"></a>go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:

<a name="l184"></a>They indoctrinate me with a private radio channel and private Internet.
<a name="l185"></a>
<a name="l186"></a>God is perfectly just.  Highs and lows balance and what you do others comes back 
<a name="l187"></a>on your own head in some way or form.
<a name="l188"></a>
<a name="l189"></a>The world is perfectly just.  Ghandi had highs and lows.

<a name="l236"></a>
<a name="l237"></a>Am I special, like Jesus Christ was special?
<a name="l238"></a>
<a name="l239"></a>This is a trick question.  The obvious answer would be &quot;of course not&quot;, but if 
<a name="l240"></a>we are the center of our own reality, it's okay.  The movie, The Matrix, had 
<a name="l241"></a>something.
<a name="l242"></a>
<a name="l243"></a>I took philosophy courses.  They suggested there might be a actual material 
<a name="l244"></a>world and then a world of illusions (ideas) that each of us sees.
<a name="l245"></a>
<a name="l246"></a>Perhaps, God bends our reality so each of us is special in our own reality.
<a name="l247"></a>
<a name="l248"></a>Where does that leave us.  Every day I fight hard against the same doubters and

<a name="l251"></a>stupid and forget how evil he is.  Don't take your eye off of him -- the enemy 
<a name="l252"></a>just pretends.  He is filled with hate, for some reason, a pathetic slave to

<a name="l271"></a>would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.

<a name="l274"></a>then was Haman full of wrath.

<a name="l276"></a>3:6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had
