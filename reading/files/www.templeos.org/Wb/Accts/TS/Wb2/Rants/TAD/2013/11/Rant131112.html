<a name="l190"></a>
<a name="l191"></a>When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
<a name="l192"></a>publically, here's what I want:
<a name="l193"></a>
<a name="l194"></a>1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is 
<a name="l195"></a>present.
<a name="l196"></a>
<a name="l197"></a>2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  
<a name="l198"></a>Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished code.)  
<a name="l199"></a>
<a name="l200"></a>3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
<a name="l201"></a>option, so CD/DVD is what we use.
<a name="l202"></a>
<a name="l203"></a>4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used 
<a name="l204"></a>along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.
<a name="l205"></a>
<a name="l206"></a>5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.
<a name="l207"></a>
<a name="l208"></a>6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.
<a name="l209"></a>
<a name="l210"></a>7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.
<a name="l211"></a>
<a name="l212"></a>8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing 
<a name="l213"></a>for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.
<a name="l214"></a>
<a name="l215"></a>9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating 
<a name="l216"></a>systems.
<a name="l217"></a>
<a name="l218"></a>10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS </span><span class=cF2>.GRA</span><span class=cF0> graphics files.  These are 
<a name="l219"></a>just right-side-up </span><span class=cF2>.BMP</span><span class=cF0> files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, 
<a name="l220"></a>with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea </span><span class=cF2>.Z</span><span class=cF0> LZW compression.  (Let me 
<a name="l221"></a>know when you want it.)
<a name="l222"></a>
<a name="l223"></a>In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as 
<a name="l224"></a>a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.
<a name="l225"></a>
<a name="l226"></a>It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
<a name="l227"></a>will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
<a name="l228"></a>Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.
<a name="l229"></a>
<a name="l230"></a>I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
<a name="l231"></a>propriatary graphics formats.
<a name="l232"></a>
<a name="l233"></a>I need to finalize RedSea and GRA, before you implement them.  (Minor changes.)

<a name="l442"></a>Paging is almost not used, but 64-bit mode requires it to be active.  Virtual is 
<a name="l443"></a>identity-mapped to physical.  All tasks on all cores use the same page table 
<a name="l444"></a>map, just as though all addresses are physical addresses.  2 Meg page table 
<a name="l445"></a>entries are used, except the first 2 Meg, which uses 4K page tables entries.  
<a name="l446"></a>Nothing swaps to disk, either.
<a name="l447"></a>
<a name="l448"></a>In TempleOS, the lowest 2 Gig of memory is called the &quot;</span><span class=cF2>code heap</span><span class=cF0>&quot;.  TempleOS's 
<a name="l449"></a>compiler always uses 32-bit signed relative JMP &amp; CALL instructions because 
<a name="l450"></a>64-bit CALLs take two instructions.  With signed +/- 32-bit values, code can 
<a name="l451"></a>only call a function within 2 Gig distance.  Therefore, TempleOS keeps all code 
<a name="l452"></a>in the lowest 2 Gig memory addresses including what would normally be called 
<a name="l453"></a>&quot;the kernel&quot;.  Two Gig is plenty, don't worry.
<a name="l454"></a>
<a name="l455"></a>You can create new, independent heaps by first allocating mem with 
<a name="l456"></a></span><a href="../../../../../../../Kernel/Mem1a.html#l404"><span class=cF4>MemBlksUncachedAlloc</span></a><span class=cF0>() or </span><a href="../../../../../../../Kernel/Mem1a.html#l191"><span class=cF4>MemBlksIndependentAlloc</span></a><span class=cF0>(), then calling

<a name="l678"></a>When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
<a name="l679"></a>publically, here's what I want:
<a name="l680"></a>
<a name="l681"></a>1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is 
<a name="l682"></a>present.
<a name="l683"></a>
<a name="l684"></a>2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  
<a name="l685"></a>Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished code.)  
<a name="l686"></a>
<a name="l687"></a>3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
<a name="l688"></a>option, so CD/DVD is what we use.
<a name="l689"></a>
<a name="l690"></a>4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used 
<a name="l691"></a>along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.
<a name="l692"></a>
<a name="l693"></a>5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.
<a name="l694"></a>
<a name="l695"></a>6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.
<a name="l696"></a>
<a name="l697"></a>7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.
<a name="l698"></a>
<a name="l699"></a>8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing 
<a name="l700"></a>for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.
<a name="l701"></a>
<a name="l702"></a>9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating 
<a name="l703"></a>systems.
<a name="l704"></a>
<a name="l705"></a>10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS </span><span class=cF2>.GRA</span><span class=cF0> graphics files.  These are 
<a name="l706"></a>just right-side-up </span><span class=cF2>.BMP</span><span class=cF0> files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, 
<a name="l707"></a>with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea </span><span class=cF2>.Z</span><span class=cF0> LZW compression.  (Let me 
<a name="l708"></a>know when you want it.)
<a name="l709"></a>
<a name="l710"></a>In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as 
<a name="l711"></a>a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.
<a name="l712"></a>
<a name="l713"></a>It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
<a name="l714"></a>will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
<a name="l715"></a>Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.
<a name="l716"></a>
<a name="l717"></a>I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
<a name="l718"></a>propriatary graphics formats.
<a name="l719"></a>
<a name="l720"></a>I need to finalize RedSea and GRA, before you implement them.  (Minor changes.)

<a name="l791"></a>
<a name="l792"></a>When God is manifest to the World and He claims this operating system, 
<a name="l793"></a>publically, here's what I want:
<a name="l794"></a>
<a name="l795"></a>1) VMware to again support PC Speaker and provide emulation if no PC Speaker is 
<a name="l796"></a>present.
<a name="l797"></a>
<a name="l798"></a>2) Windows and Linux support RedSea file system in place of FAT32 and ISO9660.  
<a name="l799"></a>Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (About 2,000 lines of blemished code.)  
<a name="l800"></a>
<a name="l801"></a>3) Windows to burn ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.  USB memory sticks are not an 
<a name="l802"></a>option, so CD/DVD is what we use.
<a name="l803"></a>
<a name="l804"></a>4) No secure boot.  TempleOS is a additional operating system that must be used 
<a name="l805"></a>along-side Windows or Linux.  It must dual boot.
<a name="l806"></a>
<a name="l807"></a>5) Mandate to PC manufacturers that ATA/ATAPI PIO must work.
<a name="l808"></a>
<a name="l809"></a>6) PS2 emulated Keyboard and Mouse must work.  The BIOS must enable these.
<a name="l810"></a>
<a name="l811"></a>7) VMware should allow ATAPI to connect real CD/DVD hardware.
<a name="l812"></a>
<a name="l813"></a>8) Perhaps, VMware can enable faster than standard x86 IN/OUT instruction timing 
<a name="l814"></a>for ATA/ATAPI PIO, so the bandwidth isn't as bad.
<a name="l815"></a>
<a name="l816"></a>9) VMware and others should list TempleOS as one of the 64-bit operating 
<a name="l817"></a>systems.
<a name="l818"></a>
<a name="l819"></a>10) Windows and Linux should support TempleOS </span><span class=cF2>.GRA</span><span class=cF0> graphics files.  These are 
<a name="l820"></a>just right-side-up </span><span class=cF2>.BMP</span><span class=cF0> files with 8-bit pixs 4-bits of color and transparency, 
<a name="l821"></a>with no palette.  Compression comes from the RedSea </span><span class=cF2>.Z</span><span class=cF0> LZW compression.  (Let me 
<a name="l822"></a>know when you want it.)
<a name="l823"></a>
<a name="l824"></a>In other words, all hardware and BIOSes must support TempleOS as a native and as 
<a name="l825"></a>a virtual system, dual booted with Windows or Linux.
<a name="l826"></a>
<a name="l827"></a>It would be neat if TempleOS were burned into BIOS ROMs.  My hope is that it 
<a name="l828"></a>will be finished and largely unchanging.  I need a good dictionary, first.  
<a name="l829"></a>Maybe, we leave the dictionary out.
<a name="l830"></a>
<a name="l831"></a>I do not intend to ever support UEFI.  That monstrocity uses elf and various 
<a name="l832"></a>propriatary graphics formats.
<a name="l833"></a>
<a name="l834"></a>I need to finalize RedSea and GRA, before you implement them.  (Minor changes.)

<a name="l1925"></a>My operating system is not a general purpose, &quot;conventional&quot; operating system 
<a name="l1926"></a>like Linux and Windows.  I want those to stay as they are.  My operating system 
<a name="l1927"></a>doesn't have to be &quot;failure is not an option&quot;.  Guess what?  If failure is an 
<a name="l1928"></a>option -- I don't have to support everything, like 6 monitor surround sound with 
<a name="l1929"></a>tread-mill input devices -- If I can fail and say, &quot;Won't do that...&quot; Then, I 
<a name="l1930"></a>can be an order of magnitude simpler from that alone.  I won't support bad disk 
<a name="l1931"></a>blocks.  Get a new drive.  I won't try to not crash.  Just reboot like we did 
<a name="l1932"></a>with DOS or a C64.  By allowing reboot as normal, that's another order of 
<a name="l1933"></a>magnitude simpler.  I will just support common pre-PCI devices.  That's two more 
<a name="l1934"></a>orders of magnitude saved.  From 50,000,000 we are down to 100,000 lines of 
<a name="l1935"></a>code.  That's where were are.  And no networking.
<a name="l1936"></a>
<a name="l1937"></a>The C64 worked fine.  You guys are talking like it would never fly.  Let's stop 
<a name="l1938"></a>and think.  You have mental blocks -- brain washing -- that would make you say a 
<a name="l1939"></a>C64 could never have worked and was useless.  How could you possibly use a C64 
<a name="l1940"></a>if it could crash and had all kinds of corner-case bugs?
<a name="l1941"></a>
<a name="l1942"></a>I don't want to talk to a test engineer.  He doesn't get it.  Put it this way -- 
<a name="l1943"></a>we have a budget of 100,000 lines of code.  If we cut corners, we can have more 
<a name="l1944"></a>stuff.  Obviously, we better not negate a byte with 128 and cause an overflow 
<a name="l1945"></a>because we're not dealing with those corner case types of things.
<a name="l1946"></a>
<a name="l1947"></a>You scoff and turn-up your nose, but it's delightful.

<a name="l1977"></a>It is a different philosophy.  We try to be simpler and less tedious, splurging 
<a name="l1978"></a>on modern technology to make heavenly simple code.  We pull all 
<a name="l1979"></a>directory-entries for a mask instead of FindFirst FindNext.  We load whole files 
<a name="l1980"></a>with comression instead of pipes and pieces of files.  This is our philosophy.
<a name="l1981"></a>
<a name="l1982"></a>The RedSea file system does not allow growing files.  Go use Linux.  I have 
<a name="l1983"></a>tested the operating system and it works well on video games.  That's what it's 
<a name="l1984"></a>for and screwing around with the computer itself as a toy, like a C64 was a toy

<a name="l2021"></a>some leading zeros.  It is really fast and elegant, but it fails if you do 50 
<a name="l2022"></a>decimal places for 10 decimal place numbers because 50 overflows the 64-bit

<a name="l2152"></a>I can't tell.  Did the assembler guy call me a liar?
<a name="l2153"></a>
<a name="l2154"></a>I have a just-in-time HolyC compiler that can be invoked on assembler 
<a name="l2155"></a>expressions.  If it hits an undefined label, it makes a new label with a spot 
<a name="l2156"></a>for its value.  In the expression assembly code, it dereferences the spot that 
<a name="l2157"></a>is going to have the label's address.  When the day of reconning comes, it does 
<a name="l2158"></a>a quick check to see if all undefined labels have been met and it evaluates the 
<a name="l2159"></a>chunk of x86_64 code for that expression.
<a name="l2160"></a>
<a name="l2161"></a>It counts-up the number of absolute addresses in an expression.  If odd, then it 
<a name="l2162"></a>makes an entry in the code-patch table used by the loader.  The loader will 
<a name="l2163"></a>fix-up that location to hold an absolute address when loaded.
<a name="l2164"></a>
<a name="l2165"></a>I mostly don't allow ORG.  You are supposed to let the loader place your code in 
<a name="l2166"></a>a chunk that is MAlloced off of the code heap (lowest 2 Gig addresses).  The 
<a name="l2167"></a>loader will patch it.
<a name="l2168"></a>
<a name="l2169"></a>I recently added a MODULE_ORG.  Only one such is allowed.  You have no business 
<a name="l2170"></a>using it.  It can be used to assemble instructions like a debugger injecting it 
<a name="l2171"></a>in a certain spot in memory.

<a name="l2173"></a>I normally get scoffers who immediately think I'm lying when I say I made an

<a name="l2211"></a>I have many ideas... maybe pathetic... I thought Gates might like to do a BASIC
