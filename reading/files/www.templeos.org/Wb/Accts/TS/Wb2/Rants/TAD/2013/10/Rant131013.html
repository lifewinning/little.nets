<a name="l159"></a>Yeah, I said Jews were &quot;hideously viscious&quot;, like cornered animals.  I have 
<a name="l160"></a>become hideously-not-family-friendly.  I feel like I am a brutal movie that 
<a name="l161"></a>cannot be seen by kids.  I'll bet a lot of war veterans feel like they should be 
<a name="l162"></a>wearing a &quot;unclean&quot; sign, like a leper.
<a name="l163"></a>
<a name="l164"></a>Sometimes, I wonder about Jesus and lepers.  If highs and lows balance, 
<a name="l165"></a>something dramatic happens around lepers.  No.  I don't know.  The real world 
<a name="l166"></a>evidence doesn't support that anything blessed happens to lepers.  However, Mary

<a name="l169"></a>I thought about how America's statue of liberty says, &quot;Send me your poor, 
<a name="l170"></a>huddled masses...&quot;  Perhaps, everybody has rich and poor parts of their lives.  
<a name="l171"></a>If we allow poor people to immigrate, then we ride the wave of their flip-side.  
<a name="l172"></a>This sounds like a sacred secret -- good countries finish first for their 
<a name="l173"></a>blessedness, while the wicked Chinese barbarian countries only allow rich, 
<a name="l174"></a>skilled people in.
<a name="l175"></a>
<a name="l176"></a>I despise Chinese philosophy.  I hate it with a passion.  It is human 
<a name="l177"></a>rationalism instead of romanticism.  &quot;Goliath will kill David unless he is

<a name="l633"></a>God says...
<a name="l634"></a></span><span class=cF4>the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 1:18 How that they told you
<a name="l635"></a>there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their
<a name="l636"></a>own ungodly lusts.
<a name="l637"></a>
<a name="l638"></a>1:19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
<a name="l639"></a>Spirit.
<a name="l640"></a>
<a name="l641"></a>1:20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,
<a name="l642"></a>praying in the Holy Ghost, 1:21 Keep yourselves in the love of God,
<a name="l643"></a>looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
<a name="l644"></a>
<a name="l645"></a>1:22 And of some have compassion, making a difference: 1:23 And others
<a name="l646"></a>save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment
<a name="l647"></a>spotted by the flesh.
<a name="l648"></a>
<a name="l649"></a>1:24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
<a name="l650"></a>present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
<a name="l651"></a>joy, 1:25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,

<a name="l655"></a>What I mean by &quot;conceit&quot; was something adults understand but not kids, in a 
<a name="l656"></a>kid's show.
<a name="l657"></a>
<a name="l658"></a>I happened to think God doing children's programs would be the best videos He 
<a name="l659"></a>could make for all generations.  Just a thought.
<a name="l660"></a>
<a name="l661"></a>I think a kids show should be for kids, not adults, so a harmless conceit is 
<a name="l662"></a>okay, but not if it interferes with the kids' benefit.
<a name="l663"></a>
<a name="l664"></a>Yeah, God would seem to threaten jobs.  Don't worry -- He's not going to put 
<a name="l665"></a>anybody out of work.  Sadly, He doesn't want to do that.

<a name="l692"></a>God says...
<a name="l693"></a></span><span class=cF4>9:25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and
<a name="l694"></a>peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he
<a name="l695"></a>burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished
<a name="l696"></a>the house.
<a name="l697"></a>
<a name="l698"></a>9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
<a name="l699"></a>beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
<a name="l700"></a>
<a name="l701"></a>9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
<a name="l702"></a>knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
<a name="l703"></a>
<a name="l704"></a>9:28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
<a name="l705"></a>hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
<a name="l706"></a>
<a name="l707"></a>10:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
<a name="l708"></a>concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard
<a name="l709"></a>questions.
<a name="l710"></a>
<a name="l711"></a>10:2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
<a name="l712"></a>that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when</span><span class=cF0>

<a name="l714"></a>So, if you need help interpreting...
<a name="l715"></a>&quot;3 times a year&quot; is similar to 184 day limit.
<a name="l716"></a>Branson is similar to Solomon when we interpret this.  Normally, I am Solomon, 
<a name="l717"></a>but not this time.
<a name="l718"></a>Solomon looks like a playboy in this passage, LOL.
<a name="l719"></a>Solomon had a fleet, lots of money...
<a name="l720"></a>
<a name="l721"></a>Branson seems like a charasmatic guy who might be slightly a lightweight -- 
<a name="l722"></a>&quot;hard questions&quot; LOL
<a name="l723"></a>
<a name="l724"></a>We want to enjoy God's company.  This is Heaven -- God being delightful.
