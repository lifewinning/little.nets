<a name="l287"></a>When you get older, you get wiser.  If I say, &quot;God talks.&quot;  A couple of minutes 
<a name="l288"></a>later, you say, &quot;There is no reason not to do stem cell research.&quot;  A wise 
<a name="l289"></a>person says to themselves, &quot;she must be an atheist because right after I said 
<a name="l290"></a>'God' she reacted with the traditional anti-god position.&quot;
<a name="l291"></a>
<a name="l292"></a>A wise person starts reading between the lines... everywhere... sometimes they 
<a name="l293"></a>go to far and get crazy, but maybe that's what the spiritual realm is?   If the 
<a name="l294"></a>radio says something, they read between the lines, like it's talking to them.
<a name="l295"></a>
<a name="l296"></a>Demensia might just be entering the delusional realm of spirits.  You are free 
<a name="l297"></a>to call it delusion, but it's plenty real.  You're a fool.  Get born again.
<a name="l298"></a>
<a name="l299"></a>I don't think that's demensia.  Once in a while I think Mom takes advantage of 
<a name="l300"></a>her condition and intentionally says &quot;What?&quot; or something similar.  that can 
<a name="l301"></a>make you furious -- faking a condition.  What a bitch.

<a name="l486"></a>I fill the screen with a simple test pattern.  It take 85% of the CPU in VMware 
<a name="l487"></a>and 16.6% natively.  That's for changing the image 100%.  Normally, it doesn't 
<a name="l488"></a>change 100% every frame, so it's not as miserable as it sounds.
<a name="l489"></a>
<a name="l490"></a>The 640x480 4 bit plane mode might be old and extra slow -- writing to 
<a name="l491"></a>0xA0000-0xBFFFF.

<a name="l493"></a>VMware is nice most times, but I really do want native mode.

<a name="l495"></a>Some people are doing higher resolutions.  They are nuts without GPU support.
<a name="l496"></a>
<a name="l497"></a>Beleive it or not, however, in my flight simulator it is my projection and fill 
<a name="l498"></a>routines that take the CPU, not bandwidth transfer time to the graphics chip.
<a name="l499"></a>
<a name="l500"></a>So, I can't really grumble.  If it is my calculation code, not the transfer, I'm 
<a name="l501"></a>happy.  What do you expect when not using a GPU?  I keep telling people there's 
<a name="l502"></a>a really good reason they make GPUs, but they won't listen.  It is hard to 
<a name="l503"></a>understand because Doom and stuff make it seem like much much better should be 
<a name="l504"></a>possible.

<a name="l537"></a>It would be cool to get better performance, even a custom GPU.  God's temple 
<a name="l538"></a>will be around a thousand years at 640x480 16 color.  They could do a GPU driver 
<a name="l539"></a>once all systems have the same GPU in 20 years? (If many GPUs in market, too 
<a name="l540"></a>many lines of code) &lt;Sigh&gt;  The caretaker might choose to keep it nonGPU, since

<a name="l598"></a>
<a name="l599"></a>I remember games I liked, now I don't like games.  I know I really liked games.  
<a name="l600"></a>What's strange is thinking of younger people, today.
<a name="l601"></a>
<a name="l602"></a>I was 9-12 when ATARI was big.  If I had been 25, they might have been too 
<a name="l603"></a>simple and stupid.  I was just the right age to ride the simple games in time 
<a name="l604"></a>all the way up until they got photo-realistic.

<a name="l618"></a>I might think all games are big production games, but what I think without 
<a name="l619"></a>knowing is there are many thousands and thousands and thousands of games, big 
<a name="l620"></a>and small.  Steam sells twenty big games for $5.
<a name="l621"></a>
<a name="l622"></a>If I get some followers who enthusiastically like my philosophy, I might tell 
<a name="l623"></a>them it's okay to continue buying Windows good-graphics games.  What we offer is 
<a name="l624"></a>computer enthusiast fun.  In a nutshell, think about this: The Commodore 64 user 
<a name="l625"></a>manual told how to draw graphics by calculating binary number bitvalues for 
<a name="l626"></a>sprites and entering them into a BASIC program.
<a name="l627"></a>
<a name="l628"></a>There is nothing more visceral then adding 1+16+64 for a bit pattern, typing a 
<a name="l629"></a>BASIC data statement and seeing the sprite when you are done.  Bill Gates is 
<a name="l630"></a>going to say, &quot;I have a web app that does just that!&quot;
<a name="l631"></a>
<a name="l632"></a>God said it was our ancestrial land and VMware was like being moved on a

<a name="l635"></a>Mine is plenty visceral, but with 8x 64-bit 3.6Ghz cores, it's not pathetic!

<a name="l839"></a>ATA/ATAPI PIO without interrupts.  I have chosen the most modest hardware 
<a name="l840"></a>because I really really want it to work for people -- I learned that on 5 
<a name="l841"></a>computer upgrades, 4 didn't go without a hitch.  Compatibility is the only thing 
<a name="l842"></a>that matters.  Without interrupts, it stands a better chance of working -- by 
<a name="l843"></a>all means, don't use interrupts, poll if you can.  I am not an arrogant fool who 
<a name="l844"></a>charges in and makes an OS that works on one in ten computers.
<a name="l845"></a>
<a name="l846"></a>I give source, but you cannot compile it unless it boots.  In other words.  You 
<a name="l847"></a>cannot fix it if it doesn't boot.  You can make an ISO distro on a machine that
