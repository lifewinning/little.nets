<a name="l41"></a>I'mna see what Putin does to Elton John.  He doesn't write his own lyrics.  That 
<a name="l42"></a>really diminishes his stature.  Elton John was on the radio and it sounded like 
<a name="l43"></a>he wanted to sing songs.  I do songs, but they are not singable.  Should I be 
<a name="l44"></a>honored to have him sing God's songs?  Sound's like the fucken Queen's joke.

<a name="l106"></a>You like elephants, God?
<a name="l107"></a>
<a name="l108"></a>Tell me an elephant story, God.
<a name="l109"></a>
<a name="l110"></a>Let's do interactive fiction.
<a name="l111"></a>
<a name="l112"></a>Once upon a time, a lone bull elephant named, Hank, gazed ahead at the water 
<a name="l113"></a>hole.  There was Gus, the mother-fucker.
<a name="l114"></a>
<a name="l115"></a>&quot;Shit, is he ever going to leave?&quot; thought Hank.
<a name="l116"></a>
<a name="l117"></a>A movement caught his peripheral vision.  He turned his head.  A baby lion was 
<a name="l118"></a>stalking him.  He sighed.  &quot;Fucken indignity after indignity,&quot; he thought to 
<a name="l119"></a>himself.

<a name="l123"></a>
<a name="l124"></a>29:20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your
<a name="l125"></a>God.
<a name="l126"></a>
<a name="l127"></a>And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and
<a name="l128"></a>bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.
<a name="l129"></a>
<a name="l130"></a>29:21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt
<a name="l131"></a>offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand
<a name="l132"></a>bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink
<a name="l133"></a>offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 29:22 And did

<a name="l135"></a>
<a name="l136"></a>The gazelles stampeded.  Hank stared.  Some gazelle was surely a goner.  &quot;Could 
<a name="l137"></a>be worse,&quot; he thought, munching on some nice plants.
<a name="l138"></a>
<a name="l139"></a>God says...
<a name="l140"></a></span><span class=cF4>Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know
<a name="l141"></a>in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.
<a name="l142"></a>
<a name="l143"></a>52:7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
<a name="l144"></a>bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good
<a name="l145"></a>tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy
<a name="l146"></a>God reigneth!  52:8 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the
<a name="l147"></a>voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when
<a name="l148"></a>the LORD shall bring again Zion.
<a name="l149"></a>
<a name="l150"></a>52:9 Break forth in</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l151"></a>
<a name="l152"></a>Hank hated lions, evil fuckers.  Maybe, he'd go fuck with them.  &quot;Kings,&quot; he 
<a name="l153"></a>snicker.  Was Gus ever going to leave?  Then, he saw a rhino.  He roared with 
<a name="l154"></a>laughter.  &quot;I better not.&quot;  (Elephants kill rhinos.)

<a name="l158"></a>that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and
<a name="l159"></a>feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept
<a name="l160"></a>alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
<a name="l161"></a>
<a name="l162"></a>5:20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,
<a name="l163"></a>he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from
<a name="l164"></a>him: 5:21 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was
<a name="l165"></a>made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild as</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l166"></a>
<a name="l167"></a>Yeah, Hank's musth season was soon.  Damn, I know I'm gonna get out of control 
<a name="l168"></a>and challenge Gus, again.  He always asked himself what the fuck he was thinking 
<a name="l169"></a>the day after.
