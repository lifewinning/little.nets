<a name="l106"></a>
<a name="l107"></a>
<a name="l108"></a>1:1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
<a name="l109"></a>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
<a name="l110"></a>
<a name="l111"></a>1:2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part

<a name="l125"></a>
<a name="l126"></a>The concept of a file system path is not relevant.  Basically, a PATH is a way 
<a name="l127"></a>of joining many directories.  There is no need for that.  In Unix and DOS, when 
<a name="l128"></a>you type a command, you expect it to search the PATH for a filename.  That type 
<a name="l129"></a>of thing does not happen.  Instead, you interact with a JIT HolyC compiler and 
<a name="l130"></a>call function names already in Adam's symbol table.  &quot;Dir;&quot; will search your 
<a name="l131"></a>hash table, not find it and search parents.  Adam is a parent. Adam has a 
<a name="l132"></a>function &quot;Dir&quot;.  It then compiles a call to Dir; and executes it.
<a name="l133"></a>
<a name="l134"></a>Do this: Get someone to explain how a C64 worked.  Typing &quot;Dir;&quot; at the 
<a name="l135"></a>command-line is like typeing &quot;GOSUB 1000&quot; at the C64 command-line.  It calls 
<a name="l136"></a>code sitting in memory.
<a name="l137"></a>
<a name="l138"></a>You could make so #include &quot;&quot; at the command-line searched all directories in a 
<a name="l139"></a>PATH, but that is a useless complexity we can save money on, or in this case 
<a name="l140"></a>brain confusion.  We live for being new and simpler.  No PATH.
