<a name="l3"></a>In terms of what purpose it is built for, the vision for Linux is a multi-user 
<a name="l4"></a>mainframe, with full protections against crashing.  The vision for TempleOS is a 
<a name="l5"></a>modern Commodore 64.  That is, I made TempleOS to serve the same niche as a 
<a name="l6"></a>Commodore 64.
<a name="l7"></a>
<a name="l8"></a>The C64 came with a manual full of BASIC programs that told how to make binary 
<a name="l9"></a>sprite DATA statements in a BASIC program.
<a name="l10"></a>
<a name="l11"></a>TempleOS identity-maps memory.  Memory will fragment.  It is a kayak, not a 
<a name="l12"></a>Titanic.  Just reboot.  Making a complete back-up is simple.  Just reinstall.  
<a name="l13"></a>Do a few fire drills, so it is second nature, and you will have amazing peace of 
<a name="l14"></a>mind.

<a name="l29"></a>10:5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error

<a name="l31"></a>and the rich sit in low place.
<a name="l32"></a>
<a name="l33"></a>10:7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants

<a name="l36"></a>10:8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an

<a name="l38"></a>

<a name="l44"></a>
<a name="l45"></a>10:11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler
<a name="l46"></a>is no better.
<a name="l47"></a>
<a name="l48"></a>10:12 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a
<a name="l49"></a>fool will swallow up himself.
<a name="l50"></a>
<a name="l51"></a>10:13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the
<a name="l52"></a>end of his talk is mischievous madness.
<a name="l53"></a>
<a name="l54"></a>10:14 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
<a name="l55"></a>and what shall be after him, who can tell him?  10:15 The labour of
<a name="l56"></a>the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to
