<a name="l3"></a>So, most people think of SHA and security when they hear &quot;hash&quot;.  If you have a 
<a name="l4"></a>command-line with 200 commands, you can use a hash for high-speed look-up.
<a name="l5"></a>
<a name="l6"></a>Make an array of 1024 linked-list-heads, fill them with NULL, then add-up the 
<a name="l7"></a>ASCII of the command names and place them in the table.  The sum of letters is a 
<a name="l8"></a>hash.  A better hash is sum with a bit shift.

<a name="l11"></a>
<a name="l12"></a>So, I have 3 redundant techniques for dealing with imports in my kernel module.  
<a name="l13"></a>I use function-pointers, I use HolyC function imports and I have an array called 
<a name="l14"></a></span><a href="../../../../../../../Kernel/Adam1b.html#l46"><span class=cF4>ext</span></a><span class=cF0>[] with function pointers that can be called from ASM.  The function-pointers 
<a name="l15"></a>can be check for NULL and not-called.  I am thinking of making HolyC imports 
<a name="l16"></a>call an empty function if used before they are defined.  I can point them to an 
<a name="l17"></a>empty function, when I get around to it.
<a name="l18"></a>
<a name="l19"></a>I changed the initial value of Binary File Imports.  A CALL instruction to call 
<a name="l20"></a>an import used to have the self-address already subtracted in its position so 
<a name="l21"></a>the import address was added.  Now, I clobber the old CALL instruction's offest 
<a name="l22"></a>completely.

<a name="l26"></a>God's temple must be perfect.  Someone says the PC is dead.  There are people

<a name="l36"></a>will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we
<a name="l37"></a>be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves
<a name="l38"></a>in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch
<a name="l39"></a>them alive, and get into the city.

<a name="l59"></a>
<a name="l60"></a>I stumbled onto Gordon Ramsay videos.  I watched them all.  It's a world far 
<a name="l61"></a>from computer nerds.  I find it interesting and wholesome.  I like to imagine 
<a name="l62"></a>eating the foods, strangely satisfying.
<a name="l63"></a>
<a name="l64"></a>I'm impressed Gordon started a new life after an injury at age 23.  Pride before 
<a name="l65"></a>a fall, humility before honors.
<a name="l66"></a>
<a name="l67"></a>Jacob, in the Bible was a cook.
<a name="l68"></a>
<a name="l69"></a></span><a href="../../../../../../../Misc/Bible.html#l76687"><span class=cF4>Malachi,1:1</span></a><span class=cF0> demanded unblemished offerings for God's temple.
<a name="l70"></a>
<a name="l71"></a>I thought Gordon Ramsay might be a good CEO for God's temple.
<a name="l72"></a>
<a name="l73"></a>If you've ever polished a turd, you know it's difficult.  Anything that looks 
<a name="l74"></a>perfect, took a whole lot of polishing.
<a name="l75"></a>
<a name="l76"></a>McDonalds hires people to make photos for ads and they use fake food.  A three 
<a name="l77"></a>star chef makes real food look good!  He has the eye for class that Steve Jobs 
<a name="l78"></a>had and he's a hundred times more charasmatic than Balmer.  He's smart, too.
<a name="l79"></a>
<a name="l80"></a>He did Christmas specials.  I think he's a Christian.
<a name="l81"></a>
<a name="l82"></a>God says...
<a name="l83"></a></span><span class=cF4>he LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even
<a name="l84"></a>to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to
<a name="l85"></a>Beersheba seventy thousand men.
<a name="l86"></a>
<a name="l87"></a>24:16 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
<a name="l88"></a>destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel
<a name="l89"></a>that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the
<a name="l90"></a>angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
<a name="l91"></a>
<a name="l92"></a>24:17 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
<a name="l93"></a>the pe</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l94"></a>
<a name="l95"></a>That was a dud.  They're never prophetic.  It might be about 70,000 lines of 
<a name="l96"></a>code.  One time, I think He said 58,000 was how many He wanted.  It's about 
<a name="l97"></a>98,000 but you could leave stuff out.
<a name="l98"></a>
<a name="l99"></a>Maybe, Gordon is an angel.  From one person's viewpoint a person can seem like 
<a name="l100"></a>an angel.  I catch myself saying unintended things, that I don't realize.
<a name="l101"></a>
<a name="l102"></a>Dud.
<a name="l103"></a>
<a name="l104"></a>I need to do videos.  Gordon is an expert at making videos, if nothing else!  I 
<a name="l105"></a>wonder how many takes he does.  I think I'm pretty lazy because two takes seems 
<a name="l106"></a>like a lot of work, LOL.
<a name="l107"></a>
<a name="l108"></a>You know what?  I write songs for an hour now and then.  When I think about 
<a name="l109"></a>doing songs for 40 hours a week, it boggles my mind what I could do.  It makes 
<a name="l110"></a>me think about all the different professionals in the world.  It's possible that 
<a name="l111"></a>Gordon does 6 takes on his videos.  A professional would do that.
<a name="l112"></a>

<a name="l119"></a>concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath
<a name="l120"></a>failed thereof.
<a name="l121"></a>
<a name="l122"></a>23:15 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are

<a name="l124"></a>bring upon you all evil things,</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l125"></a>
<a name="l126"></a>Dud.  Might be a joke -- if you ignore bad prophecy, you have to also ignore 
<a name="l127"></a>good.  LOL  Try to get a sense of God's personality -- He's not boring, He's a 
<a name="l128"></a>character.

<a name="l139"></a>Cooking and baby elephants are delightfully in-the-light.  The radio talked 
<a name="l140"></a>about an atom bomb.  That's dark.  LOL.  I have suffered much torment and 
<a name="l141"></a>learned to stay in-the-light, or suffer terror.  I make an effort to stay 
<a name="l142"></a>in-the-light, but don't mind slipping into dark.  Dark is what we crave and move 
<a name="l143"></a>toward naturally.  You have to make an effort to stay in-the-light.  Evolution 
<a name="l144"></a>is dark.  War is dark.
<a name="l145"></a>
<a name="l146"></a>Japan really tries to stay in-the-light as penance.  God bless them.  Staying in

<a name="l148"></a>
<a name="l149"></a>Anyway, I like cooking.  I like to praise God for stuff and I ran out of 
<a name="l150"></a>animals.  I can praise Him for all the foods!  I like coconuts.  I think they're 
<a name="l151"></a>really neat.  All the foods are neat.
<a name="l152"></a>
<a name="l153"></a>So... I praise God for animals and foods.  LOL

<a name="l171"></a>
<a name="l172"></a>You know?  To love God you have to enjoy evil.  LOL.  God wants to crush your 
<a name="l173"></a>enemies.  What do you say if God crushes your enemies.  You're probably too 
<a name="l174"></a>scared to love evil, but you insult God.  Don't be proud of heart.  Proud of 
<a name="l175"></a>heart is not accepting a gift, from God!  When you begin to have real love for 
<a name="l176"></a>God, you'll see the real God is more lovable than the Catholic God.  God said 
<a name="l177"></a>war was &quot;servicemen competing.&quot;  That shows He's real and lovable, for real.
<a name="l178"></a>
<a name="l179"></a>I've heard it said that nobody likes celebrities that are too perfect.  I'm not 
<a name="l180"></a>sure that's true or not.  God doesn't only want bad stuff for you, some 
<a name="l181"></a>honest-to-good good stuff!

<a name="l201"></a>I sit there an think about all the wonderful foods in Gordon's videos.
<a name="l202"></a>
<a name="l203"></a>I asked Jesus if He liked mustard a lot.  &quot;Bad meat happeneth&quot;
<a name="l204"></a>
<a name="l205"></a>I wonder what Gordon thinks of A1 steak sauce.
<a name="l206"></a>
<a name="l207"></a>I guess sauce insults cooks.
<a name="l208"></a>
<a name="l209"></a>God really freaked-out and got angry about rare meat.  God really does not like 
<a name="l210"></a>eating blood.  Chefs like to make it as rare as possible.  God does not like 
<a name="l211"></a>that.

<a name="l241"></a>They say the public really doesn't want to see sausage or laws being made.
<a name="l242"></a>
<a name="l243"></a>I saw Gordon make sausage.  Praise God that He made those neat little 
<a name="l244"></a>ready-to-use edible tubes, just right for sausage...  And they plunk!
<a name="l245"></a>
<a name="l246"></a>So, I made a compiler+assembler.  When I'm working on it, I behave really 
<a name="l247"></a>dangerously, though, nothing bad can really happen.  The worst that could happen 
<a name="l248"></a>would be me compiling my disk code and the compiler making a bug that corrupted 
<a name="l249"></a>my disk.  It has happened once or twice.
<a name="l250"></a>
<a name="l251"></a>I change my compiler and think nothing of turning-it loose on all my code.  It's 
<a name="l252"></a>just the fastest way to develop it.  I change it make it LIVE! In action on all 
<a name="l253"></a>my code!
<a name="l254"></a>
<a name="l255"></a>Two things can happen -- the compiler can crash as it compiles or it can make 
<a name="l256"></a>bad code that crashes.
<a name="l257"></a>
<a name="l258"></a>I get risky until I get burned and make a bad mistake, then I get conservative 
<a name="l259"></a>for a while.  I try to do testing.  I don't test everything.  There are just too 
<a name="l260"></a>many cases.  I'm a good boy because I made a big automated test suite, at least.
<a name="l261"></a>
<a name="l262"></a>My operating system is pretty solid, but I stay within habits.
<a name="l263"></a>
<a name="l264"></a>One time, probably 5 years into my compiler, I was totally shocked to discover
<a name="l265"></a>
<a name="l266"></a></span><span class=cF2>if (i&lt;5) puts(&quot;Hello&quot;); //This worked.
<a name="l267"></a>
<a name="l268"></a>if (5&gt;i) puts(&quot;Hello&quot;); //This made bad code!</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l269"></a>
<a name="l270"></a>I just never do yoda conditionals, so I never noticed.  In a nutshell, I know 
<a name="l271"></a>there are lots of bugs to uncover if people try perfectly reasonable stuff, that 
<a name="l272"></a>I just never do.  I try not to press my luck multitasking.  If I'm in the middle 
<a name="l273"></a>of something, the last thing I want is to corrupt the disk, so I don't risk 
<a name="l274"></a>doing multitatsking-type stuff when running scripts, for example.  It's somewhat 
<a name="l275"></a>safe, but there are lots of KNOWN and INTENDED dangers you can stumble upon, 
<a name="l276"></a>like deleting a directory while someone is in it.  Don't do that, moron!  (It's 
<a name="l277"></a>easy to forget something like that.)
<a name="l278"></a>
<a name="l279"></a>God says...

<a name="l281"></a>men should fear before him.

<a name="l284"></a>been; and God requireth that which is past.
<a name="l285"></a>
<a name="l286"></a>3:16 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
<a name="l287"></a>wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity
<a name="l288"></a>was there.
<a name="l289"></a>
<a name="l290"></a>3:17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
<a name="l291"></a>wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every
<a name="l292"></a>work.

<a name="l303"></a>
<a name="l304"></a>What happened was, I flipped a conditional to put the immediate second but I 
<a name="l305"></a>made the mistake of doing a NOT on the conditional after flipping it.
<a name="l306"></a>
<a name="l307"></a>I took:
