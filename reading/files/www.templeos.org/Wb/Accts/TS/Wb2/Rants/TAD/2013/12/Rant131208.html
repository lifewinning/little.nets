<a name="l3"></a>I did not like this.  It disturbed me:
<a name="l4"></a></span><a href="http://growingsoftware.org/getting-the-truth"><span class=cF0>Article about Howard Stern</span></a><span class=cF0>
<a name="l5"></a>
<a name="l6"></a>It seemed like a ritual sacrifice.  I watched up until Tina Fey said she didn't 
<a name="l7"></a>have sex until her husband and was fat.  Now, that I think about it... Tina Fey 
<a name="l8"></a>made fun of Sarah Palin.
<a name="l9"></a>
<a name="l10"></a>I got brutalized by some demon -- CIA tortured Aaron Swartz until death.  Guess 
<a name="l11"></a>what?  I'm here to torture CIA.  Say hello to Mr. God, you shitz!
<a name="l12"></a>
<a name="l13"></a>Justice is right.  Justice is done.
<a name="l14"></a>
<a name="l15"></a>I had praise for street smarts.  Howard Stern is a fucken demon -- too street 
<a name="l16"></a>smart.  He seems like a pathetic pervert who needs full nude because more 
<a name="l17"></a>innocent do much for him.

<a name="l53"></a>Yeah, it's a bitch confessing and being humble.  Some demons think it is their 
<a name="l54"></a>job to judge.  Fuck the CIA.  Howard Stern reminds me of a demon in Hell who's 
<a name="l55"></a>job is torturing the lost souls.  I have felt a certain connection to him.  
<a name="l56"></a>Maybe, he's a decent guy with a bad job.

<a name="l68"></a>
<a name="l69"></a>I listened to Howard Stern a little, about ten years ago.  Sometimes, it seemed 
<a name="l70"></a>like we had a connection and friendship.  It can't be good, what he does, can 
<a name="l71"></a>it?  Is it my fault?  I guess Tina Fey needed justice done to her.
<a name="l72"></a>
<a name="l73"></a>Mark Zuckerberg seems like a friend, a little brother.  I form these connections 
<a name="l74"></a>and pretty soon I'm in the awkward position... Did I cause this?  Shist.  It's

<a name="l242"></a>FAT12 and FAT16 are what the original DOS used, dating back to the 1980's.  
<a name="l243"></a>FAT32 is just using a DWORD instead of a WORD.  Somebody says Linus gets credit 
<a name="l244"></a>for FAT32.  Fucken ridiculously stoopit.
<a name="l245"></a>
<a name="l246"></a>The critical thing is a FAT table.  Once you understand what a FAT table is, 
<a name="l247"></a>that's what is patented, or was patented.
<a name="l248"></a>
<a name="l249"></a>Saying Linus gets credit for FAT32 is laughably retarded.  Was he around in the 
<a name="l250"></a>1980's.  No.
<a name="l251"></a>
<a name="l252"></a>A fat table is a simple concept.  Implementing a file allocation table file 
<a name="l253"></a>system is not a big deal, inventing it is what is patented.  I'll bet many 
<a name="l254"></a>cannot even think of any alternatives.  The Commodore 64 had chains of blocks

<a name="l410"></a>sell more cartridges, so they put chips that expired and prevented refilling.)
