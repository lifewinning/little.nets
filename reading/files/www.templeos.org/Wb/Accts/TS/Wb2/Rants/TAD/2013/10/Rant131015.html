<a name="l714"></a>
<a name="l715"></a>Most people think Brave New World is ghastly, but it's actually Christian!  I 
<a name="l716"></a>think all the people who want to be God and kill stupid people should just 
<a name="l717"></a>chill-out and meditate on Brave New World.  There is more to life than IQ.  When 
<a name="l718"></a>humans breed dogs, there's a species of purebreds that is deaf!  Race horses 
<a name="l719"></a>have weak legs.  A liberal thought I actually like is... &quot;Humans are not anygood 
<a name="l720"></a>at breeding -- leave it to God.&quot;  It's okay if God does natural selection, but I 
<a name="l721"></a>really don't want humans doing it.  God wants human evolution, you can count on 
<a name="l722"></a>it.  God can even do conception mutations and match-making, causing evolution 
<a name="l723"></a>with no pain!
<a name="l724"></a>
<a name="l725"></a>I sat and pondered evolution of milk consumption in humans.  Do you realize you 
<a name="l726"></a>have to basically kill everybody except one pair just to get something like that 
<a name="l727"></a>universal?  Am I wrong?  Each of these universal traits in humans must happen 
<a name="l728"></a>one at a time almost where that trait is the only one selected where, everybody 
<a name="l729"></a>but one pair dies.  (Not literally, but something like that!  It's a mutation 
<a name="l730"></a>from one person and becomes universal!)
<a name="l731"></a>
<a name="l732"></a>You have proven God does not exist, geniuses, now prove He does.  Go prove 
<a name="l733"></a>evolution could not happen because the probabilities are absurd.  Obviously, it 
<a name="l734"></a>did happen, but God really exists.  Truth is... well...  evolution probably 
<a name="l735"></a>requires God!  Seriously.  As weird as that is... evolution requires God.

<a name="l789"></a>Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to just 
<a name="l790"></a>blocks on RedSea.)
<a name="l791"></a>
<a name="l792"></a>3) Windows burns ISO files to CD/DVD-ROMS.

<a name="l794"></a>4) No secure boot.

<a name="l810"></a>
<a name="l811"></a>If we remove FAT32 and ISO9660, we can add more stuff.  God's temple must be
