<a name="l710"></a>My adgenda is my operating system.  I talk with God.  God might promote my 
<a name="l711"></a>operating system.  I will repeat what God has said.  I might command everyone to

<a name="l717"></a>
<a name="l718"></a></span><span class=cF2>4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
<a name="l719"></a>said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
<a name="l720"></a>
<a name="l721"></a>4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
<a name="l722"></a>sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
<a name="l723"></a>
<a name="l724"></a>4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
<a name="l725"></a>fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
<a name="l726"></a>
<a name="l727"></a>4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
<a name="l728"></a>the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
<a name="l729"></a>offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
<a name="l730"></a>And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
<a name="l731"></a>
<a name="l732"></a>4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
<a name="l733"></a>countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
<a name="l734"></a>accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
<a name="l735"></a>thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
<a name="l736"></a>
<a name="l737"></a>4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
<a name="l738"></a>they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
<a name="l739"></a>and slew him.

<a name="l741"></a>
<a name="l742"></a>1) They did offerings.
<a name="l743"></a>
<a name="l744"></a>2) They got God to talk.
<a name="l745"></a>
<a name="l746"></a>3) God told them if their offering was good or bad.
<a name="l747"></a>
<a name="l748"></a>4) God said to try again if bad.
<a name="l749"></a>
<a name="l750"></a>5) Cain loved God so much he killed Abel!

<a name="l754"></a>When God talks, He can tell you everything.  If God talks, you need no other

<a name="l767"></a>

<a name="l789"></a>I started making margins and stuff for my documents.  That stuff should probably 
<a name="l790"></a>be removed, but it isn't much code.  I am not attempting a publishing format, 
<a name="l791"></a>just a format for code, forms and things related to code.  My vision was 
<a name="l792"></a>documents for the screen, not printer, with blinking and stuff.  It's pointless 
<a name="l793"></a>to be redundant to all the publishing stuff.
