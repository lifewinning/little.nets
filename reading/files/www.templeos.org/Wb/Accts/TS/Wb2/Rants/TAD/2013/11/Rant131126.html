<a name="l3"></a>I made a Tank wargame.  To me, it's as abstract and innocent as chess.  I'm 
<a name="l4"></a>laughing, listening to a story on the BBC about Unkrane siding with Russia or 
<a name="l5"></a>Europe.  It's like worrying about black/white race relations in games of chess.

<a name="l23"></a>bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.

<a name="l1809"></a>I just read Brendan proudly talking about his scheduler queues.  I use simple 
<a name="l1810"></a>round-robin that doubles as window-z-order.
<a name="l1811"></a>
<a name="l1812"></a>Brendan matter-of-factly talks about his fancy scheduler.  He seems to think my 
<a name="l1813"></a>simple scheduler is simple because I couldn't make it complex.  Use a little 
<a name="l1814"></a>psychology.  I wrote a compiler.  My scheduler is simple.  Is my scheduler 
<a name="l1815"></a>simple becuase I'm not smart enough to make it complicated?
<a name="l1816"></a>
<a name="l1817"></a>Let me explain my company name &quot;Trivial Solutions&quot;.  Guess what makes my day?  
<a name="l1818"></a>Using things that are brilliantly simple.
<a name="l1819"></a>
<a name="l1820"></a>My operating system in ring-0-only.
<a name="l1821"></a>My operating system is identity-mapped.
<a name="l1822"></a>My operating system has a round-robin scheduler on each core.
<a name="l1823"></a>
<a name="l1824"></a>My operating system crashes on the slightest thing.  DOS and a C64 crashed on 
<a name="l1825"></a>the slightest thing.  Back when we all used DOS, ask yourself... did we 
<a name="l1826"></a>freak-out if it hung or crashed?  Back then, we just rebooted and a booted fast.
<a name="l1827"></a>
<a name="l1828"></a>If you have a multiuser mainframe, crashing and rebooting is bad.
<a name="l1829"></a>
<a name="l1830"></a>When writing code in Visual Studio, you frequently hang a process.  How long 
<a name="l1831"></a>does it take to kill it and restart- 30 seconds?  Why is rebooting any worse if 
<a name="l1832"></a>it boots fast?  It's not.  You're a snob.  You have a snobby issue with 
<a name="l1833"></a>rebooting.  You're a clown/pussy.
<a name="l1834"></a>
<a name="l1835"></a>I don't have a good debugger.  Once you reach multitasking multicore, you don't 
<a name="l1836"></a>want to be debugging, LOL.
<a name="l1837"></a>
<a name="l1838"></a>I have a 100,000 line of code limit.  It's at 83,100.  I got the start of a 
<a name="l1839"></a>debugger written.  Maybe, one of you wants to improve it.  It does quite a bit 
<a name="l1840"></a>-- it will let you step through code and it brings-up source files and finds the 
<a name="l1841"></a>line numbers.  My window paint is done by the window manager task with a 
<a name="l1842"></a>callback.  That fucks everythign up.  If you break-point the window manager

<a name="l2524"></a>About 8 years ago, I thought immigration should be fixed so laws matched 
<a name="l2525"></a>reality.  All Hell broke loose and it was almost race riots.
<a name="l2526"></a>
<a name="l2527"></a>I thought it unfair that uninsured got treatment in emergencies.
<a name="l2528"></a>
<a name="l2529"></a>It's no fun being in charge, when you fail.  Sometimes, failure comes before 
<a name="l2530"></a>success.

<a name="l2532"></a>God says...

<a name="l2534"></a>first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this

<a name="l2536"></a>
<a name="l2537"></a>50:18 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
<a name="l2538"></a>Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have
<a name="l2539"></a>punished the king of Assyria.
<a name="l2540"></a>
<a name="l2541"></a>50:19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall
<a name="l2542"></a>feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount
<a name="l2543"></a>Ephraim and Gilead.
<a name="l2544"></a>
<a name="l2545"></a>50:20 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of
<a name="l2546"></a>Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of
<a name="l2547"></a>Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I

<a name="l2556"></a>I have not suffered terror in a while.  The psy-ops want me to fear war with

<a name="l2571"></a>
<a name="l2572"></a>7:13 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although
<a name="l2573"></a>they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude

<a name="l2599"></a>I asked God what He likes best about zoos.  He said something like &quot;Dignity&quot;.
<a name="l2600"></a>
<a name="l2601"></a>Even simple animals have a sense of dignity.  I think that's impressive and 
<a name="l2602"></a>surprising.  My birds have a sense of dignity.  That seems way more complex than 
<a name="l2603"></a>their other personality traits.
