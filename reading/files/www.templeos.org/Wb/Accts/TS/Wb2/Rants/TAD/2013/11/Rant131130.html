<a name="l949"></a>God likes wit.
<a name="l950"></a>
<a name="l951"></a>Irish people have a tendancy to talk really earnestly with their hearts on their 
<a name="l952"></a>sleaves.  They think honesty is the highest virtue and if someone is talking 
<a name="l953"></a>from the heart, it is holy.
<a name="l954"></a>
<a name="l955"></a>You must learn that keeping your mouth shut is a virtue.  Droning on and on is 
<a name="l956"></a>bad.  Be witty.

<a name="l962"></a>wearysome.&quot;  Oh yeah, huh!  God doesn't want to hear it.  Keep it to yourself.  
<a name="l963"></a>Don't remind Him of sin.
<a name="l964"></a>
<a name="l965"></a>LISTEN UP!  I have a radical idea.  Justice for sins is unchangable.  Don't ask 
<a name="l966"></a>God to not do justice.  Forget about sin.  Leave justice and sins out of your 
<a name="l967"></a>relationship with God.  God is a relationship -- with the Creator.

<a name="l2610"></a>18:8 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
<a name="l2611"></a>said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have
<a name="l2612"></a>ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
<a name="l2613"></a>18:9 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
<a name="l2614"></a>
<a name="l2615"></a>18:10 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God
<a name="l2616"></a>came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David
<a name="l2617"></a>played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in
<a name="l2618"></a>Saul's hand.
<a name="l2619"></a>
<a name="l2620"></a>18:11 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even
<a name="l2621"></a>to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
<a name="l2622"></a>
<a name="l2623"></a>18:12 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and
<a name="l2624"></a>was departed from Saul.
<a name="l2625"></a>
<a name="l2626"></a>18:13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
<a name="l2627"></a>over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.

<a name="l2646"></a>22:66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the

<a name="l2649"></a>them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 22:68 And if I also ask you,
<a name="l2650"></a>ye will not answer me, nor let me go.
