<a name="l2"></a>
<a name="l3"></a>I saw a story of a church converted to a book store.  I don't love neighbor; I 
<a name="l4"></a>love God.  When you look at what people do to show love to God, it's really sad. 
<a name="l5"></a>Nice churches are about the only thing.  I saw a nice, modern church. God said, 
<a name="l6"></a>&quot;secular glass.&quot;  It made my cry.

<a name="l12"></a>for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one,
<a name="l13"></a>for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 6:18 And the golden
<a name="l14"></a>mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines
<a name="l15"></a>belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country
<a name="l16"></a>villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the
<a name="l17"></a>ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of
<a name="l18"></a>Joshua, the Bet</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l19"></a>
<a name="l20"></a>LOL!  That's from when they stole the Ark.  It gave them hemeroids, so they 
<a name="l21"></a>returned it.

<a name="l24"></a>
<a name="l25"></a>I have little birds -- Percival and Tomorrow.  God named them.  You're not 
<a name="l26"></a>supposed to test God.  I used to never do anything to force God to act, just let 
<a name="l27"></a>Him comment, if He felt like it.  If you force God to act, just realize He might 
<a name="l28"></a>not do it.  I joke that God would shoot hostages.
<a name="l29"></a>
<a name="l30"></a>God says...
<a name="l31"></a></span><span class=cF4>Go up to Hilkiah the
<a name="l32"></a>high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the
<a name="l33"></a>house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the
<a name="l34"></a>people: 22:5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the
<a name="l35"></a>work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them
<a name="l36"></a>give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to
<a name="l37"></a>repair the breaches of the house, 22:6 Unto carpenters, and builders,
<a name="l38"></a>and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.

<a name="l42"></a>I don't go to church.  I made God's temple!  I'm not very normal.  I wouldn't 
<a name="l43"></a>say, I'm Catholic, but I'm not going to be a rebel for the sake of being a 
<a name="l44"></a>rebel.  If something is true, it's true.  Reaching spiritual maturity is a long 
<a name="l45"></a>road.  Sometimes, I say I &quot;graduated&quot; from Catholicism, being serious, not 
<a name="l46"></a>snarky.

<a name="l60"></a>Dud.  Kinda.  I don't think Churches want people who might disturb the sheep.
<a name="l61"></a>
<a name="l62"></a>One time, Mom wanted me to go venerate the Eucharist.  They think God is in the 
<a name="l63"></a>bread and they keep Him company.  Jesus said, &quot;Where two or more are gathered, 
<a name="l64"></a>I'm in your midst.&quot;  So, I said to Mom, &quot;What do we need to go over there for?&quot;  
<a name="l65"></a>Perhaps, the Eucharist is a dead chunk of flesh and a live spirit is present 
<a name="l66"></a>when you talk to each other.  Spirits do make you say stuff.  You can hear 
<a name="l67"></a>spirits in yourself and others when you talk.

<a name="l74"></a>they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the

<a name="l78"></a>your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the
<a name="l79"></a>palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the

<a name="l84"></a>I joke, &quot;What are you helping Africa for, God's doing disasters!&quot;  Naw, you 
<a name="l85"></a>gotta help.  It's probably not good to root for God if He goes about punishing 
<a name="l86"></a>people.  &quot;You get those sinners, God!&quot;  If you love God, though, and believe, 
<a name="l87"></a>&quot;Thy will be done...&quot;  You can kinda laugh.
