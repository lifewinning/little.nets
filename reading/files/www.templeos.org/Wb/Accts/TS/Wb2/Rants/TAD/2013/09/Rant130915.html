<a name="l523"></a>First, trust me that I am smarter than anyone you know.
<a name="l524"></a>
<a name="l525"></a>I started in TASM and wrote an interpreter for my command-line in the first 
<a name="l526"></a>month -- 2004.  Over the next ten years, full-time, I made it into an optimizing 
<a name="l527"></a>JIT or AOT x86_64 compiler.  All of you make the command-line like Linux.  You 
<a name="l528"></a>are young and never saw a C64, and you are stupid, so you cannot imagine 
<a name="l529"></a>anything but Linux command-line.  My generation all learned 6502 assembly 
<a name="l530"></a>language.  Seriously.  We all used DOS interrupts when DOS was common.  Turbo C 
<a name="l531"></a>had an &quot;interrupt&quot; key word for interrupt routines.  I put an &quot;interrupt&quot; key 
<a name="l532"></a>word in my compiler, so it saves regs and returns with IRET.
<a name="l533"></a>
<a name="l534"></a>Did I not tell you I was smarter and anyone you know.  Do you think MikeOS is as 
<a name="l535"></a>smart as making a compiler with an &quot;interrupt&quot; keyword?  No.  He's not a smart 
<a name="l536"></a>man.  All the smart people who knew assembly stopped using it, for good reason.  
<a name="l537"></a>Do you doubt this?  Do I need to beat you until you stop this nonsense thinking 
<a name="l538"></a>assembly is good when the whole smart world stopped using it?  You think MikeOS 
<a name="l539"></a>guy is smarter than all of my generation who learned asm and stopped using it?
<a name="l540"></a>
<a name="l541"></a>Let me explain.  This is programmer psychology:  Assembly is the opposite of 
<a name="l542"></a>nigger.  Interrupt is the opposite of nigger.  Polling is for niggers.
<a name="l543"></a>
<a name="l544"></a>Some people were told this and have no clue why and simply have no judgement on 
<a name="l545"></a>when asm is good, when polling is good, when interrupts are good -- they are 
<a name="l546"></a>sure it's for niggers.

<a name="l591"></a>
<a name="l592"></a>I took 5 assembly classes.
<a name="l593"></a>
<a name="l594"></a>CSC226 was Intel x86 assembly.  We made a B8000 window manager similar to 
<a name="l595"></a>Borland's IDE.
<a name="l596"></a>
<a name="l597"></a>CSC326 was Intel x86 assembly part II.  We had a lab.  We programmed PIC and PIT 
<a name="l598"></a>in all configurations, including non-IBM-PC PIC modes.  We scanned keypad grids 
<a name="l599"></a>with I/O and we made 7-segment displays operate by strobing them in sequence.
<a name="l600"></a>
<a name="l601"></a>CSC421 was Motorola 6800 assembly for embedded systems.  It was an 8-bit CPU 
<a name="l602"></a>similar to a 6502.  We learned what every instruction did.  We did scaled 
<a name="l603"></a>fixed-point math for Feirenheight to Celsius, like you might find on a 
<a name="l604"></a>thermocouple in a car engine.  Motorola made chips for cars.
<a name="l605"></a>
<a name="l606"></a>CSC422 was M6800, hardware.  We learned the digital logic for gluing M6800.  It 
<a name="l607"></a>had two processors on high and low memory cycles, one for I/O.
<a name="l608"></a>
<a name="l609"></a>CSC523 was M6800 part III.  We were graded on a curve on how short our assembly 
<a name="l610"></a>programs were.  I got an A.  Our last 2-week project was a multitasking 
<a name="l611"></a>scheduler.
<a name="l612"></a>
<a name="l613"></a>CSC120 was digital logic.  We made a simulated CPU from scratch, including 
<a name="l614"></a>microcode and stuff.
<a name="l615"></a>
<a name="l616"></a>CSC330 was computer architecture.  We learned the harvard bus or whatever -- 
<a name="l617"></a>microcode and stuff.
<a name="l618"></a>
<a name="l619"></a>I took a compiler course.
<a name="l620"></a>
<a name="l621"></a>I took an operating system course.
<a name="l622"></a>
<a name="l623"></a>I took a computer graphics course.  We made a 3D package from scratch.  We 
<a name="l624"></a>studied bezier and bsplines.
<a name="l625"></a>
<a name="l626"></a>I took a numeric methods course.  I know the hidden bit.
<a name="l627"></a>

<a name="l629"></a>
<a name="l630"></a>I have been paid to program in 6 different assembly languages with maybe 5 years 
<a name="l631"></a>of solid assembly.

<a name="l633"></a>VAX TicketMaster operating system
<a name="l634"></a>80x86 for PC half of file compression package I did.  I also did it in VAX 
<a name="l635"></a>assembly.
<a name="l636"></a>68000 I did a barcode reader networking device.  I found bugs in TMNet a 
<a name="l637"></a>networking device.  I did a bar code reader image processor.
<a name="l638"></a>8051  I did a wall line voltage regulator.  I modified a stepper motor 
<a name="l639"></a>controller at Xytec.
<a name="l640"></a>
<a name="l641"></a>PIC (tiny 8-bit microcontroller by MicroChip) -- made a bogus EEPROM to fool a 
<a name="l642"></a>printer/copier to allow refilling toner.
<a name="l643"></a>Atmel AVR -- Did an experimental toner level sensor, that didn't see production.
<a name="l644"></a>Did some more 8051 work.
<a name="l645"></a>
<a name="l646"></a>All of that was bare metal with no 3rd party software.

<a name="l777"></a>print to the command-line.  It has a limit on number of entries, not quite 
<a name="l778"></a>number of line, but similar.  It doesn't check the count and delete very 
<a name="l779"></a>frequently.  It only checks sometimes -- when the window is drawn at 60Hz.
<a name="l780"></a>
<a name="l781"></a>I discovered something funny.  If you have a task printing to the command-line 
<a name="l782"></a>and the window is completely covered, the limit on number of entries is never

<a name="l1325"></a>PCI devices intimidate me.  You have 4 interrupt lines per bus.  I did a demo to 
<a name="l1326"></a>prove I could do them.  </span><a href="../../../../../../../Demo/Lectures/PCIInterrupts.html#l1"><span class=cF4>PCIInterrupts.CPP</span></a><span class=cF0>  What about interrupt sharing?  The 
<a name="l1327"></a>BIOS sets them up, or something?  Once I realized that every class of PCI device 
<a name="l1328"></a>would require multiple drivers and that all PCI generation devices were an order 
<a name="l1329"></a>of magnitude more complicated and that different drivers unified under an 
<a name="l1330"></a>abstraction layer would always have the nasty problem of supported and 
<a name="l1331"></a>unsupported capabilities.  I just decided PCI was not a fit, for my simple 
<a name="l1332"></a>beautiful-to-look at pleasant source code.

<a name="l1350"></a>OSDev said mine is PE?  No, my compiler is my own type of binary format.
<a name="l1351"></a>
<a name="l1352"></a>OSDev said I use glibc?  No, I don't use any code I did not write.  Technically, 
<a name="l1353"></a>I call a couple BIOS routines during boot.
<a name="l1354"></a>
<a name="l1355"></a>I told you I wrote my own compiler.  That means I am in a superior league and 
<a name="l1356"></a>would likely do all the lessor stuff myself, too, like bootloaders.
