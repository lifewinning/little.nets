<a name="l1307"></a>about line-count of the project.  A big project demands added administation, 
<a name="l1308"></a>that's a drag.  Compile times, for example, increase.  If you have lots of

<a name="l1314"></a>It might be NSA.

<a name="l1333"></a>a lot of agony over my conscience.  When I went from being an atheist, I dug 
<a name="l1334"></a>deep for what was right.  I kinda aimed for Little House on the Prarrie as the 
<a name="l1335"></a>moral highest ground... that was just what I found when I dug for the highest 
<a name="l1336"></a>moral model.  I had concerns over oil running-out and that kind of thing.  You'd 
<a name="l1337"></a>laugh at all the notions people get when filled with Holy Terror and wanting to 
<a name="l1338"></a>do what they think is right.  By the way, buying 5 pound bags of sugar and flour
