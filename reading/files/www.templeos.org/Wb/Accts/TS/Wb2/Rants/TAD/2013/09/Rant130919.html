<a name="l2"></a>
<a name="l3"></a>Chuck Swindoll's book, Wisdom for the Way, is really good.
<a name="l4"></a>
<a name="l5"></a></span><span class=cF2>Solitude removes bitterness.
<a name="l6"></a>Obscurity removes pride.
<a name="l7"></a>Time removes fear.</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l8"></a>
<a name="l9"></a>I heard a really pleasing quote elsewhere.
<a name="l10"></a>
<a name="l11"></a></span><span class=cF2>Learn modesty from the elephant.</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l12"></a>
<a name="l13"></a>That quote is a clever way to praise God.  Sit down, some time and look at the 
<a name="l14"></a>Bible from an author point-of-view.  Your eyes will be opened to seeing it as 
<a name="l15"></a>poetry that praises the Father.  i.e. &quot;Look to the ant, thou sluggard.&quot;  The 
<a name="l16"></a>book of Job is full of many many created things.
<a name="l17"></a>
<a name="l18"></a>Jesus said the Father makes sure the birds have food.  He got that from the Old 
<a name="l19"></a>Testament.
<a name="l20"></a>
<a name="l21"></a>God says...
<a name="l22"></a></span><span class=cF4>5:22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I
<a name="l23"></a>will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of
<a name="l24"></a>your fat beasts.
<a name="l25"></a>
<a name="l26"></a>5:23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not
<a name="l27"></a>hear the melody of thy viols.
<a name="l28"></a>
<a name="l29"></a>5:24 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a
<a name="l30"></a>mighty stream.
<a name="l31"></a>
<a name="l32"></a>5:25 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
<a name="l33"></a>wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?  5:26 But ye have borne the
<a name="l34"></a>tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images,</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l35"></a>
<a name="l36"></a>That's about Chinese-like spirituality.  Confucisism.
<a name="l37"></a>
<a name="l38"></a>God, You have no taste -- the elephant quote is awesome!
<a name="l39"></a>
<a name="l40"></a>One time God told me to get a job or something.  I said I was a better person 
<a name="l41"></a>when I was employed and an atheist before He talked to me.  He said, &quot;That's 
<a name="l42"></a>your opinion.&quot;
<a name="l43"></a>
<a name="l44"></a>That's actually a profound thought -- we don't have to have the same opinion as 
<a name="l45"></a>God.
<a name="l46"></a>
<a name="l47"></a>There is justice, highs and lows, balancing.  Then, there is your personal 
<a name="l48"></a>relationship with God.  It's really good to keep them separate.
<a name="l49"></a>
<a name="l50"></a>God called sports and pets, &quot;homo&quot;.  That's kinda bad, but God said He loves 
<a name="l51"></a>gays, one time.
<a name="l52"></a>
<a name="l53"></a>God says...

<a name="l58"></a>I could see if Gordon wants to blog.  I guess my blog files belong in MY 
<a name="l59"></a>directory.  I'm not doing stuff for delusional people.  Maybe, I'll get around

<a name="l65"></a>
<a name="l66"></a>I said God kinda lies.
<a name="l67"></a>
<a name="l68"></a></span><span class=cF2>4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who
<a name="l69"></a>maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the

<a name="l71"></a>thee what thou shalt say.
<a name="l72"></a>
<a name="l73"></a>4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
<a name="l74"></a>whom thou wilt send.
<a name="l75"></a>
<a name="l76"></a>4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,
<a name="l77"></a>Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.
<a name="l78"></a>And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth
<a name="l79"></a>thee, he will be glad in his heart.
<a name="l80"></a>
<a name="l81"></a>4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I
<a name="l82"></a>will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye
<a name="l83"></a>shall do.
<a name="l84"></a>
<a name="l85"></a>4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,
<a name="l86"></a>even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him
<a name="l87"></a>instead of God.
<a name="l88"></a>
<a name="l89"></a>4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt
<a name="l90"></a>do signs.</span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l91"></a>
<a name="l92"></a>Jacob &quot;wrestled an angel&quot; which is something I, too, have done.  God loved Jacob 
<a name="l93"></a>and hated Esau.  I heard one preacher say that Jacob &quot;tussled&quot; with God.
<a name="l94"></a>

<a name="l98"></a>You'll see, smart-ass!

<a name="l199"></a>If you talk with God every day, you have to realize that the Bible is the

<a name="l712"></a>There was an unemployed woman in San Francisco.  She placed an ad saying &quot;Zen 
<a name="l713"></a>yoga guru&quot; or something, having no credentials.  A rich man hired her.  She did 
<a name="l714"></a>what everybody expects yogu gurus to say and got paid.

<a name="l716"></a>Lesson?  A con artist always tells you what you expect to hear and of course 
<a name="l717"></a>never says anything strange or unconventional that would raise suspicions!
<a name="l718"></a>
<a name="l719"></a>I talked about writing a Gordon Ramsay video game.  It really seemed stupid, but 
<a name="l720"></a>the expectation would be very predictable.  It turns-out they made the exact 
<a name="l721"></a>game I had in mind.
<a name="l722"></a>
<a name="l723"></a>The Pope tells people what they expect to hear.  The way he thinks is, 
<a name="l724"></a>basically, I'm going to dig inside and say the most Catholic thing I can think 
<a name="l725"></a>of.  What else should he do?  I don't know, but he's no prophet.

<a name="l742"></a>The Catholic moral compass is, basically, if it's bad it must be good.  Ice 
<a name="l743"></a>cream, for example, is good so it's bad -- it's an indulgence.  Pleasures and 
<a name="l744"></a>pains balance.  (I don't know but it looks that way.)

<a name="l746"></a>I bitterly hate this song -- </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgFQ6WmxdMs"><span class=cF0>Simple Man</span></a><span class=cF0>.  Someone in the Bible praised Satan for 
<a name="l747"></a>being a glorious creature and warned not to diminish his glory.  Go get a

<a name="l752"></a>A Chinese person has probably figured-out highs and lows balancing.  We are not 
<a name="l753"></a>Chinese -- our religion is supposed to be about the person of God, not mechanics 
<a name="l754"></a>of justice.
<a name="l755"></a>
<a name="l756"></a>The purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God.  The story of Cain 
<a name="l757"></a>and Abel is pretty-much good enough.  Do offerings, see if God likes them, 
<a name="l758"></a>passionately love God so much, you kill out of jealousy.  Hell is the absence of 
<a name="l759"></a>God, my Mom said.  Heaven must be God's company.  You don't love God, you just 
<a name="l760"></a>fear hell.  God loved David most and David was the opposite of a coward.  I can 
<a name="l761"></a>imagine that the average Mexican wants fortune telling if they talk with God.  
<a name="l762"></a>Just spend time with God and don't want anything.  </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTBx-hHf4BE"><span class=cF4>One Tin Soldier</span></a><span class=cF0>  Jesus said

<a name="l1081"></a>
<a name="l1082"></a>Earlier I said I had a teacher who made us handle NEG 0x80 to the nth degree.  
<a name="l1083"></a>That's being a professional programmer.  Maybe, I'm an artistic faggot, but I 
<a name="l1084"></a>want to dance my own way.  I want to be different and elegant by not doing all 
<a name="l1085"></a>those corner cases, if they're not especially needed. 
<a name="l1086"></a>
<a name="l1087"></a>It turns-out I have a really fast routine for, say, &quot;%12.6f&quot;.  On numbers, you 
<a name="l1088"></a>go backward.  I use a stack data structure to reverse digits.  I look at the 6.  
<a name="l1089"></a>  I forget.  I think I subtract the integer part from decimal.  Then, I multiply 
<a name="l1090"></a>by 10 to the 6th from an array look-up table.  Then, I make it into a 64-bit 
<a name="l1091"></a>integer and print push the digits on the stack, like you would expect.  I print 
<a name="l1092"></a>the zeros and the decimal.  I print the Int, or if I have to multiply it, I 
<a name="l1093"></a>multiply by a look-up table power ot ten array.
<a name="l1094"></a>
<a name="l1095"></a>(This cuts corners, makes beautiful use of having 64-bit word size, is elegant 
<a name="l1096"></a>and fast.  Unfortuinately, printf is silly being ultra fast.  I get problems if 
<a name="l1097"></a>you specify &quot;%50.30f&quot;  Mine craps-out, unless the number is tiny.  It sounds 
<a name="l1098"></a>bad, but you just have to be careful not to overdo precision. It gives you all 
<a name="l1099"></a>the precision in the double, but if you do way more than a double has, well mine 
<a name="l1100"></a>fucks up.  Don't over do the format size beyond 64-bit integer sitting in the 
<a name="l1101"></a>decimal region.
<a name="l1102"></a>
<a name="l1103"></a>At ticketmaster, I saw a luxury ultra-delux main-frame VAX environment.  We had 
<a name="l1104"></a>a format statement that would do commas or decimals every so many characters, 
<a name="l1105"></a>use a special digit for decimal point and pad the whole thing with a character.
<a name="l1106"></a>
<a name="l1107"></a>Mine will do 3-digit commas and a decimal.  
<a name="l1108"></a>
<a name="l1109"></a>I have an engineering notation.

<a name="l1111"></a>For integers, mine will print Meg or K, if you like.
