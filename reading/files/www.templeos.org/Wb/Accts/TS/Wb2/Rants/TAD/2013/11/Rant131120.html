<a name="l866"></a>The RedSea file system is just like FAT32 but it has an allocation bitmap 
<a name="l867"></a>instead of FAT.  It can only have contiguous files and files cannot change size 
<a name="l868"></a>to get bigger.  This is not suitable, normally, but for us it's okay.  An 
<a name="l869"></a>additional difference is that the directory entries are fixed-size and limited 
<a name="l870"></a>filename length.  They are 64-byte entries with 38 length including a zero.
<a name="l871"></a>
<a name="l872"></a>Our goal is to be obnoxiously simple.  That's what we live for.  I wake-up every 
<a name="l873"></a>day trying to find more ways to be obnoxiously simple.
<a name="l874"></a>
<a name="l875"></a>A CDROM need not have an allocation bitmap.  Oops, I forgot -- I was not even 
<a name="l876"></a>thinking about multi-session CDDVD burning.
<a name="l877"></a>
<a name="l878"></a>There are probably times I am not obnoxiously simple.  I don't care.
<a name="l879"></a>
<a name="l880"></a>I am certainly not low resource usage.  Quite the contrary.  I like to use 
<a name="l881"></a>resources to make it obnoxiously simple.  When hardware gets more powerful, some 
<a name="l882"></a>new possibilities open-up.  Almost all the time, I load and save whole files at 
<a name="l883"></a>once.  Traditional file-to-disk virtual memory is obsolete.  Have you ever 
<a name="l884"></a>actually triggered it and seen how unacceptibly slow it is!  If the guide is 
<a name="l885"></a>SWAP equal to RAM size, heck for a factor of two more memory, just buy more 
<a name="l886"></a>memory.  I can understand virtual memory for a factor of ten more memory but a 
<a name="l887"></a>factor of two more memory, just makes no sense because it's so terrible.

<a name="l891"></a>Once we calm down, you might soon decide my operating system is no news at all.  
<a name="l892"></a>I'm not keen on the thought of helping drones, so I'm relieved if mine's not 
<a name="l893"></a>hard-real-time.  If you think about it, ring-0-only is not the issue, it's 
<a name="l894"></a>simplicity.  People can do hardware in Linux, but mine is simpler.
<a name="l895"></a>
<a name="l896"></a>I remember the nice, clean, architecture of a Motorola 68020 and starting a 
<a name="l897"></a>fresh assembly project with no other code.  That is not sinister.
<a name="l898"></a>
<a name="l899"></a>God said we are being moved-off our ancestrial lands.
<a name="l900"></a>
<a name="l901"></a>So, the horsepower is higher, good for cameras, I guess.
<a name="l902"></a>
<a name="l903"></a>In the past, I would have sought to do robots, and would have tried to make them 
<a name="l904"></a>good, as in scary.  I played with a dremel tool on a stepper motor platform.  I 
<a name="l905"></a>scratched that itch.  I have no plans and shit is too hard.
<a name="l906"></a>
<a name="l907"></a>Shit is much harder to hook-up.  It used to be simple to do an RS232 serial port 
<a name="l908"></a>driver.  Now, sheesh!  &lt;shakes his head&gt;  USB is insanely overengineered.  
<a name="l909"></a>Ethernet?  Camera?  I don't have any plans for hardware.
<a name="l910"></a>
<a name="l911"></a>Young men should have the feeling of starting fresh on a Motorola 68020 in 
<a name="l912"></a>assembly language.  Not literally, but approximately.
