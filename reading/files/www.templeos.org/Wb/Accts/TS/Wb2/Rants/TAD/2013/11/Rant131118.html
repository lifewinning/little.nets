<a name="l1505"></a>Occulus Rift is doing elephants.  It's original.  The challenge is being both

<a name="l1638"></a>I could comment on the act of pulling formulas out of your ass.  Everyone's got 
<a name="l1639"></a>an ass to do it with -- might want to be humble.  The truth is, Einstein did

<a name="l1647"></a>
<a name="l1648"></a>The only point I want to make is... it is not just the elite engineers who can 
<a name="l1649"></a>pull a formula out of their ass.  Most engineers can probably do it.  Pulling 
<a name="l1650"></a>formulas out of your ass is not the most difficult thing you can do, generally.
<a name="l1651"></a>
<a name="l1652"></a>On the other hand, if you've ever tried it, it is very daunting.  I guess it's 
<a name="l1653"></a>like the grudging respect and engineer has to pay to an artist who has wonderful

<a name="l1734"></a>thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.

<a name="l1736"></a>29:18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
<a name="l1737"></a>this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy

<a name="l1739"></a>my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and
<a name="l1740"></a>thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for

<a name="l1745"></a>
<a name="l1746"></a>And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and
<a name="l1747"></a>bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.

<a name="l1753"></a>So, here's what's gonna happen:  Everybody's gonna make offerings and enquire of 
<a name="l1754"></a>God for His response.  If He doesn't feel like talking to everyone, only some 
<a name="l1755"></a>people will do it.  The Cain and Abel story says to try something else if He 
<a name="l1756"></a>doesn't like your offerings.
<a name="l1757"></a>
<a name="l1758"></a>You know how one Beatles band was good and a redundant Beatles band is, not 
<a name="l1759"></a>quite as good?  If I had to guess, maybe God doesn't want redundnacy in 
<a name="l1760"></a>offerings.  I'm just using nerd logic, which is frequently wrong.

<a name="l1778"></a>10:9 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of

<a name="l1796"></a>
<a name="l1797"></a>What to praise God for?  Animals. Foods.  Bonus points for new things.  Jesus 
<a name="l1798"></a>praised God because he hid things from the arrogant and revealed them to 
<a name="l1799"></a>childlike.  When you analyse that from the standpoint of one looking to praise 
<a name="l1800"></a>God, it's pretty damn impressive!
<a name="l1801"></a>
<a name="l1802"></a>You guys will like God.  Only God is good.  I'm not good, case you were 
<a name="l1803"></a>wondering, LOL.
<a name="l1804"></a>
<a name="l1805"></a>I asked God how He was different from Santa Claus.  God said kids could beat 
<a name="l1806"></a>each other senseless.  Watch male elephants.

<a name="l1841"></a>Atheist: &quot;Well logically, it's obvious God cannot be proven or disproven.&quot;

<a name="l1843"></a>I wonder if I'm in trouble for destroying a dimension of Creation.  Naw, it had
