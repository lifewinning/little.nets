<a name="l82"></a>When I was taught to estimate assembly language instruction times, we counted 
<a name="l83"></a>the memory fetches for the instruction and memory fetches for the operation.  I 
<a name="l84"></a>got to thinking about MMU's with paging and it takes 4-5 memory fetches to look 
<a name="l85"></a>up all the levels of paging for each access!  It doesn't take a genius to 
<a name="l86"></a>figure-out no paging is faster!  (It's required for long mode, however.)
<a name="l87"></a>
<a name="l88"></a>Today, I moved my compiler code out of low memory and it, now, executes faster.  
<a name="l89"></a>My lowest 2 Meg range of memory has 4 level paging with 4K pages, but upper

<a name="l176"></a>I hate the concept of generating content ahead of time.  I hate multimedia.
<a name="l177"></a>
<a name="l178"></a>I did sound for SimStructure, a Windows game.  Compared to the Commodore 64, 
<a name="l179"></a>sound in Windows is difficult, unless you just want to play a WAV file.  That 
<a name="l180"></a>pisses me off.
<a name="l181"></a>
<a name="l182"></a>I want no multimedia, pregenerated content in my operating system.
<a name="l183"></a>
<a name="l184"></a>I don't plan to support networking; I plan to always have it a special purpose 
<a name="l185"></a>secondary operating system.  I wouldn't mind FTP if someone added it.  We are 
<a name="l186"></a>keeping the 100,000 LOC limit, however.
<a name="l187"></a>
<a name="l188"></a>If you are not doing &quot;multimedia&quot;, and are doing 640x480 16 color VGA, you will 
<a name="l189"></a>never run out of memory.  If you are doing &quot;multimedia&quot;, you will immediately

<a name="l192"></a>Basically, I told you what my vision was -- a souped-up, 64-bit Commodore 64.
<a name="l193"></a>
<a name="l194"></a>Yes, it has multitasking, but has no fancy algorithms for sharing the drive.  If 
<a name="l195"></a>one task loads a 20 Meg file, nobody can use the drive until it's done.  The 
<a name="l196"></a>target is video games and in a video game you don't typically have two tasks 
<a name="l197"></a>fighting over the drive, maybe just one.
<a name="l198"></a>
<a name="l199"></a>I have thoroughly tested and proved that it works for what I intended.  Study 
<a name="l200"></a>what I have done and you will see what its good for.

<a name="l1772"></a>I don't know modern CPU architecture on instruction pipelines and stuff.  I just 
<a name="l1773"></a>made my compiler make pretty code that made me happy.  I picked size over speed, 
<a name="l1774"></a>not because it's rational.  I don't want to go bloat the think by unrolling 
<a name="l1775"></a>loops!
