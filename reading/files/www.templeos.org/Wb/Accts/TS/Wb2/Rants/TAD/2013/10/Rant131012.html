<a name="l629"></a>13:30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till
<a name="l630"></a>all these things be done.
<a name="l631"></a>
<a name="l632"></a>13:31 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
<a name="l633"></a>away.
<a name="l634"></a>
<a name="l635"></a>13:32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels
<a name="l636"></a>which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
<a name="l637"></a>
<a name="l638"></a>13:33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
<a name="l639"></a>
<a name="l640"></a>13:34 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
<a name="l641"></a>his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his
<a name="l642"></a>work, and commanded the porter to watch.</span><span class=cF0>

<a name="l650"></a>
<a name="l651"></a>I'm afraid it's too late for elephant videos -- anybody reading left.
<a name="l652"></a>
<a name="l653"></a>You know what was freaky?  The elephant trying to talk, but stuck in an 
<a name="l654"></a>elephant's body.
<a name="l655"></a>
<a name="l656"></a>Elephants are pleasant mellow laid back.  They're like a kid kicking dirt, 
<a name="l657"></a>sometimes.

<a name="l669"></a>on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.

<a name="l671"></a>19:7 And all the men were about twelve.

<a name="l673"></a>19:8 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of
<a name="l674"></a>three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the
<a name="l675"></a>kingdom of God.
<a name="l676"></a>
<a name="l677"></a>19:9 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil
<a name="l678"></a>of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated
<a name="l679"></a>the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
<a name="l680"></a>
<a name="l681"></a>19:10 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they

<a name="l697"></a>Perhaps, Heaven is when people crave God's delightful company and love.

<a name="l699"></a>Competition, achievement, success... oh, they are pleasures hard to replace -- 
<a name="l700"></a>it hurts without them, even though you have priceless companionship with God.

<a name="l711"></a>6:26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the
<a name="l712"></a>other cherub.
<a name="l713"></a>
<a name="l714"></a>6:27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they

<a name="l716"></a>one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the

<a name="l735"></a>The thought of a mirror can freak you out -- like God as a mechanical thing you

<a name="l743"></a>I'm an exhibitionist.  Jesus explicitly said to pray in private.  That sucks.

<a name="l745"></a>I think I'm on top of the world, but actually deluded, so is it private or
