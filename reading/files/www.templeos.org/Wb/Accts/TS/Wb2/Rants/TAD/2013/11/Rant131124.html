<a name="l1195"></a>The down-sides of identity-mapped (single address space) are obvious.  
<a name="l1196"></a>Hopefully, you see the up-sides.  I never have to copy address spaces or 
<a name="l1197"></a>anything.  All tasks can access all memory, no sweat.  One task doesn't have 
<a name="l1198"></a>duplicate numbers to other tasks -- all addresses are unique.
<a name="l1199"></a>
<a name="l1200"></a>I get a lot of confused people who enter with preconcieved notions, like 
<a name="l1201"></a>7FFF,FFFF is stack and 8000,0000+ is kernel and heap is, I donno, 2000,0000.
<a name="l1202"></a>
<a name="l1203"></a>None of that is correct.
<a name="l1204"></a>
<a name="l1205"></a>Under 7FFF,FFFF is &quot;code heap&quot; but it has global variables too for now unless 
<a name="l1206"></a>you set a compiler option.  Many programmers don't know anything but global 
<a name="l1207"></a>variables, LOL.  There is heap memory which is 1,0000,0000+, etc.

<a name="l1210"></a>
<a name="l1211"></a>There are trade-offs to ring-0-only identity-mapped.  Stack cannot expand is 
<a name="l1212"></a>probably the worst.  Don't worry, the up-sides are very nice.
<a name="l1213"></a>
<a name="l1214"></a>Fuck you if you hide the obvious up-sides to ring-0-only identity-mapping.  Some 
<a name="l1215"></a>fucken cow is gonna play dumb, stare at me chewing cud with a dumb expression.  
<a name="l1216"></a>Many times, have I tried to explain stuff to my little brother, Sean.  I get 
<a name="l1217"></a>angrier and angrier the dumber and dumber he is.  I am seething mad by the time 
<a name="l1218"></a>I have tried to explain something.
<a name="l1219"></a>
<a name="l1220"></a>For example, assume I had to explain ring-0-only to Sean, my brother, not a 
<a name="l1221"></a>computer guy (just don't attempt such things, but say I had to).  I would be so 
<a name="l1222"></a>fucken angry by the time I finished.  Imagine a teacher who throws questions to 
<a name="l1223"></a>see if the class is following and the class is just not understanding anything!  
<a name="l1224"></a>I get operating system people who simply behave like dumb fucken cows on 
<a name="l1225"></a>something simple like ring-0-only identity-mapping.  The play dumb.  Kevin my 
<a name="l1226"></a>brother provokes me, intentionally, playing dumb in a cocky way.  Say something 
<a name="l1227"></a>is not possible, that asks how to do it.  Some people call you a liar.  Makes me 
<a name="l1228"></a>furious.  &quot;Didn't I just fucken say that!?&quot;

<a name="l1499"></a>I took 5 assembly language courses in school and have been paid to program in 
<a name="l1500"></a>VAX assembly on Ticketmaster's operating system.  I wrote a VAX and a x86 file 
<a name="l1501"></a>compression for TM in assembly language.  I wrote an 8051 assembly language 
<a name="l1502"></a>firmware to control a device that used an A2D to monitor wall voltage and switch 
<a name="l1503"></a>taps to correct wall voltage, I wrote a 68020 bar code reader RS232 networking 
<a name="l1504"></a>device and a 68020 barcode image processing assembly thing.  I did a 8051 
<a name="l1505"></a>stepper motor driver thing for my 3 axis milling machine, I did a PIC 
<a name="l1506"></a>microcontroller for making a replacement chip for toner cartriges in PIC 
<a name="l1507"></a>assembly language, I did a AVR Tiny12 assembly for a device to monitor toner

<a name="l1509"></a>
<a name="l1510"></a>I started my operating system in 1993.  IN school I took 2 x86 assembly courses 
<a name="l1511"></a>where we programmed the PIT and PIC and made a b8000 window management package

<a name="l1516"></a>Why on Earth do I not get the respect Knuth gets?  I wrote an operating system 
<a name="l1517"></a>that is widely used for ten years.  Some nigger wants to question my boot

<a name="l1519"></a>years?  He thinks it doesn't boot?
<a name="l1520"></a>
<a name="l1521"></a>I fucken wrote my own God damn assembler.  This nigger is lecturing me on 
<a name="l1522"></a>segmentation?  My assembler does not support segmentation -- you must hand code 
<a name="l1523"></a>the number because FUCKEN USE IT PROPERLY AS IT WAS INTENDED.  It is a 64-bit 
<a name="l1524"></a>operating system and users have no business in 16 bit mode.  It supports just 
<a name="l1525"></a>enough 16 bit to boot.
<a name="l1526"></a>
<a name="l1527"></a>In a perfect world, we would not teach our children 16 bit x86 assembly, just 
<a name="l1528"></a>64-bit x86 assembly.  Why are you filling their heads with segmentation?  
<a name="l1529"></a>Useless.
<a name="l1530"></a>
<a name="l1531"></a>I learned to program in assembly language in 1983 on my Commodore 64.  I wrote a 
<a name="l1532"></a>routine to calculate the slope of a line and add fractions to draw a line on my 
<a name="l1533"></a>C64 in 6502 assembly.  I used a MUL and a DIV from a book.
<a name="l1534"></a>
<a name="l1535"></a>My generation all learned x86 real mode assembly, but none of them has learned

<a name="l1620"></a>Not a single computer science major is taught the concept of overengineering.  I 
<a name="l1621"></a>was a computer systems engineer.  I did not take an algorithm class, but I took 
<a name="l1622"></a>five assembly language courses and digital design and the engineering core.  I 
<a name="l1623"></a>had a class, where we programmed in M6800 asm and were graded on a curve on how 
<a name="l1624"></a>short our code was.
<a name="l1625"></a>
<a name="l1626"></a>Guess what?  It is always going to be 100,000 lines of code.  It will never be 
<a name="l1627"></a>more.  It does not have to be designed to grow.  It is like a C64 ROM.  There 
<a name="l1628"></a>will not be libraries.  Developers will bring their own libraries, in the same 
<a name="l1629"></a>way C64 had no market for 3rd party libraries.

<a name="l1633"></a>be at home, knowing it is a limited amount of code they dwell within, that they 
<a name="l1634"></a>can master.
<a name="l1635"></a>
<a name="l1636"></a>Any idiot can make it complicated.  Nobody ever gets criticized for 
<a name="l1637"></a>overengineering.  In fact, you will get praised and respected even if you

<a name="l1655"></a>Denny Denker was my boss when I did the Ticketmaster Report Generator.  He had 
<a name="l1656"></a>me put a &quot;cursor movement&quot; command into it.  The way it was used was... they 
<a name="l1657"></a>would get a list of names of customers, addresses, shows, and transactions, for 
<a name="l1658"></a>example, and print invoices.  Often, they printed on top of form-stationary with 
<a name="l1659"></a>blanks to be typed-in.  The report format had &quot;cursor movement&quot; commands to 
<a name="l1660"></a>print into another location.
<a name="l1661"></a>
<a name="l1662"></a>For the Ticketmaster RepGen, we had a 2 page buffer that you could move 
<a name="l1663"></a>up-the-page on to continue printing, making another layer of text, more or less.
<a name="l1664"></a>
<a name="l1665"></a>I put the report generator features into this operating system.  The cursor 
<a name="l1666"></a>movement is useful, but I take a performamnce hit on account of it being allowed 
<a name="l1667"></a>to move any number of lines up the page.

<a name="l1670"></a>
<a name="l1671"></a>I decided NOT to serialize output to STDOUT.  A Commodore 64 let you move the 
<a name="l1672"></a>cursor from the bottom and interact with text above the bottom in ways that have 
<a name="l1673"></a>a state.  Also, I print graphics to the command-line, not serialized.  There is 
<a name="l1674"></a>a HEXEDIT widget that updates, live.  I have text with callback functions that 
<a name="l1675"></a>can update.  You can redefine #define strings.

<a name="l1971"></a>Here is a quick guide to HolyC, assumning you start with C/C++ knowledge.
<a name="l1972"></a>
<a name="l1973"></a>There is policy of HolyC compilers defined in an unusual way.  If a value finds 
<a name="l1974"></a>its way into a register, it has been promoted up to a 64-bit size.  All 
<a name="l1975"></a>intermediate operations will take place on 64-bits.  When a value is written 
<a name="l1976"></a>back to memory, it can be truncated.
<a name="l1977"></a>
<a name="l1978"></a>I do not mess with math operations on any size but 64-bits.
<a name="l1979"></a>
<a name="l1980"></a>
<a name="l1981"></a>We are currently at 83,000 lines of code.  We are free to expand up to 100,000 
<a name="l1982"></a>lines, but it is a precious resource. (Getting rid of FAT32 and ISO9660 will 
<a name="l1983"></a>save about 2000) For 1000 years, they will be limited to 100,000 lines of code 
<a name="l1984"></a>as a charter kind-of-thing.  In the future, they can migrate to other hardware.  
<a name="l1985"></a>God said 640x480x 4bit color was manditory.  As an exercise, draw an elephant in 
<a name="l1986"></a>16 colors and draw an elephant in 24-bit color.  This kind-of prevents an arms 
<a name="l1987"></a>race.  The goal of the Temple is a place for everybody to do offerings.  As 
<a name="l1988"></a>content creators, 16-color is less tedious for nonartists and artists, alike.
<a name="l1989"></a>
<a name="l1990"></a></span><img src="http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Accts/TS/Wb2/Elephant02.BMP" width="640" height="472" alt=""><span class=cF3>                                                                                                  </span><span class=cF0>
<a name="l1991"></a>
<a name="l1992"></a>I need to graduate to the next level of artistry.  I need to stop trying to make 
<a name="l1993"></a>it look realistic and make it have style and character.  Each different comic 
<a name="l1994"></a>strip has a style.  The style adds value.  You do not draw a comic strip hoping 
<a name="l1995"></a>for realistic-looking art.  This is an additional reason God's choice of 16 
<a name="l1996"></a>colors looks good.  Could just say &quot;Because He said so!&quot;  Shat-up.

<a name="l2504"></a>Here's something.  I obnoxiously scorned laptops, at first.  I wanted highest 
<a name="l2505"></a>performance for multicore, so I did not put cores into a HALT state.  (They 
<a name="l2506"></a>spinned at a flag, buring power.)   If you signal with a memory flag, it is 
<a name="l2507"></a>faster than doing an interrupt to get it out of HALT.  The overhead for doing a 
<a name="l2508"></a>multicore job determines how small the jobs can be and still be worthwhile.
<a name="l2509"></a>
<a name="l2510"></a>----11/24/13 16:09:12----
<a name="l2511"></a>
<a name="l2512"></a>I had a BIOS which set-it-up so that the keyboard interrupt worked, but not the 
<a name="l2513"></a>mouse.  Well, shit!  So, about 60 times a second, I check if a byte is waiting 
<a name="l2514"></a>from the mouse.
<a name="l2515"></a>
<a name="l2516"></a>When I did HD Audio, I did not use interrupts.  I checked a thousand times a 
<a name="l2517"></a>second to see if the DMA buffer needed more speaker output data.
<a name="l2518"></a>
<a name="l2519"></a>With huge DMA buffers, you could get by without interrupts.  You need a timer 
<a name="l2520"></a>interrupt.  I thought about DMA done by other cores.
<a name="l2521"></a>
<a name="l2522"></a>If, for some reason, you wanted clean, minimal silicon.  My operating system 
<a name="l2523"></a>doesn't require paging.  You could use multicore in place of DMA.  You only need 
<a name="l2524"></a>a timer interrupt.

<a name="l4185"></a>It really says &quot;praise&quot;, mostly.  I told my sister to praise God and she said,

<a name="l4187"></a>
<a name="l4188"></a>If you tell a Catholic to praise God they will thank God.

<a name="l4192"></a>
<a name="l4193"></a>
<a name="l4194"></a>I must be firm.  The Bible says to praise God.  It doesn't say create poems that 
<a name="l4195"></a>make yourself proud.
<a name="l4196"></a>
<a name="l4197"></a>&quot;Praise you father because you hid from the wise and revealed to childlike.&quot;

<a name="l4240"></a>My bootloaders move their own code to a higher, known, location.  One time, I 
<a name="l4241"></a>learned there is an EBDA, the hard way.  It was very fortunate because there was

<a name="l4244"></a>At this point, you pack your bags and go home.  Fuck them.  PC operating systems

<a name="l4247"></a>If the BIOS doesn't feel like enabling PS/2 keyboard moused or ATA PIO, fuck 
<a name="l4248"></a>them.  They might not feel like enabling interrupts.
<a name="l4249"></a>
<a name="l4250"></a>In the past ten years, I have owned four machines.  Each time I upgraded, my 
<a name="l4251"></a>operating system was dead until I got it working, except one time out of four.
<a name="l4252"></a>
<a name="l4253"></a>If statistic sampleing 4 samples and 3 were defective, no reason for hope -- I'm
