<a name="l109"></a>My inspiration is a Commodore 64, not a 1970's mainframe.  I spent a lot of time 
<a name="l110"></a>learning about computers and horsing-around.  It's strange to think about it 
<a name="l111"></a>this way, but how many hours of entertainment did I get from poking and prodding 
<a name="l112"></a>the system out of curiosity?  You can get entertainment without accomplishing 
<a name="l113"></a>anything, just looking around and exploring.  I loved this book:

<a name="l116"></a>adding bit values together and putting them in DATA statements.
<a name="l117"></a>
<a name="l118"></a>Can you believe that!!!?  The fucken user's manual that went to every user made 
<a name="l119"></a>it normal to add bit values to make graphics!  Every user was entertained by 
<a name="l120"></a>tinkering in ways they ban you from now and mock.  But we liked it!  It was fun 
<a name="l121"></a>because it was cutting edge, true, but it was also fun because it as on bare 
<a name="l122"></a>metal.  This is not a good analogy, by pyrotechniques are fun -- fireworks -- 
<a name="l123"></a>yeah the professional firework shows are okay.
<a name="l124"></a>
<a name="l125"></a>Guess what?  The fucken CIA and Microsoft is saying &quot;Of course you don't need

<a name="l127"></a>shows.&quot;  If you say you want your personal fireworks, they call you a terrorist

<a name="l526"></a>I value consistency.
<a name="l527"></a>
<a name="l528"></a>My compiler has a rule on it's code -- if a value finds a way into a register, 
<a name="l529"></a>it has been promoted by sign extension or zero extension.  All operations are 
<a name="l530"></a>done on 64-bit values.
<a name="l531"></a>
<a name="l532"></a>Therefore, my compiler is best with 64-bit ints in the first place.  When I have 
<a name="l533"></a>a function return value or argument, I tend to make it 64-bit no matter what, so 
<a name="l534"></a>that my compiler does not waste byte sign or zero extending.
<a name="l535"></a>
<a name="l536"></a>Always use 64-bits, signed, unless it physically breaks.  Literally.  Even when 
<a name="l537"></a>it's wrong to use signed, use signed unless it breaks.
<a name="l538"></a>
<a name="l539"></a>I value consistency.  I value not having to make decisions.  Instead of

<a name="l667"></a>I think about those years working on Ticketmaster VAX operating system.  We took 
<a name="l668"></a>great satisfaction in building things that would last forever.  Little did we 
<a name="l669"></a>know it was all a waste.  I'll bet the people at Microsoft no longer feel they 
<a name="l670"></a>are building permanance.
<a name="l671"></a>
<a name="l672"></a>Permanance makes all the difference on moral.  If it only lasts a few years, 
<a name="l673"></a>there is no moral.  Linux is feeling immortal.  Must be complete shit if they 
<a name="l674"></a>did not break compatibility and they support all that shit.  If it's complete 
<a name="l675"></a>shit, it almost as bad as doomed in 3 years.
<a name="l676"></a>
<a name="l677"></a>Microsoft will last, but it's not the same as before phones and consoles.  It's 
<a name="l678"></a>kind of depressing.  I get depressed when I see stuff like Zoo Simulator -- some

<a name="l823"></a>my 60 fps refresh scheme, wastes power, too.
<a name="l824"></a>
<a name="l825"></a>I might not recompile just for fun, so much, LOL.  It's kinda like being around 
<a name="l826"></a>an 80-year-old and obsessing on death.  They're not gonna die for a while.
<a name="l827"></a>
<a name="l828"></a>One lesson I would teach people is that perfect and infinity are very different 
<a name="l829"></a>from imperfect and finite... not so much in how much difference they make, but 
<a name="l830"></a>in how people think about them.  After-all, there is virgin and not-virgin...  
<a name="l831"></a>it's not fair, but they don't distingish that much beyond that, just like drugs.
<a name="l832"></a>
<a name="l833"></a>I got used to not being competative for database servers and stopped thinking 
<a name="l834"></a>about that.  (My disk I/O was not competative.)  &quot;Good work if you can get it,&quot; 
<a name="l835"></a>is what they say about people who don't have to compete.  I don't think it's in 
<a name="l836"></a>the cards to make it a server OS.  The exception would be a transparent simple 
<a name="l837"></a>server for... extremely conservative own-your-business nuts, maybe like my 
<a name="l838"></a>brother Kevin for his book store.
<a name="l839"></a>
<a name="l840"></a>A data base where you put records in disk blocks and number the blocks by 
<a name="l841"></a>account number... might be fun, like do-it-yourself home improvement.
<a name="l842"></a>
<a name="l843"></a>We don't have networking, though.

<a name="l878"></a>He might be in for some ... excitement.  It was rough when I was converted, but
