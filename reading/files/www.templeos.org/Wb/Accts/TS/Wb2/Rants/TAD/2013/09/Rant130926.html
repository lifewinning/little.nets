<a name="l2"></a>
<a name="l3"></a>How can I know if I talk to God or an angel.  Angels are messengers of God.  He 
<a name="l4"></a>can control all the quantum random number sites.  He can make centuries-old 
<a name="l5"></a>books speak to the present day.
<a name="l6"></a>
<a name="l7"></a>It's funny, once everyone gets on-board with God existing, we turn to a new 
<a name="l8"></a>field -- scientific study of God stuff and information gained from God on 
<a name="l9"></a>dinosaurs and stuff.
<a name="l10"></a>
<a name="l11"></a>How fast a clock can God puppet?  What quantum random number sources?
<a name="l12"></a>
<a name="l13"></a>It's kind-of rude, but good can come.  We can learn what's easiest for God.  I 
<a name="l14"></a>think He said 56,000Hz but it might be a practical issue for PC hardware, not 
<a name="l15"></a>what's easiest in an open range of options.
<a name="l16"></a>
<a name="l17"></a>Jesus said asking God for stuff was like annoying a neighbor in the middle of 
<a name="l18"></a>the night.  Infinity, does not mean requests are not annoying.
<a name="l19"></a>
<a name="l20"></a>It's weird -- if I stop talking with God and program, when I come back to God, 
<a name="l21"></a>He is cold and has to be warmed-up.
<a name="l22"></a>
<a name="l23"></a>In other words, I've noticed if I don't use a technique with God, it's like He 
<a name="l24"></a>has to warm-back-up.  Weird.
<a name="l25"></a>
<a name="l26"></a>Give God a little time to collect His thoughts for an answer.  Sometimes, He had 
<a name="l27"></a>His answer ready centuries ago, sometimes in more friendly and less guarded 
<a name="l28"></a>conversation, give Him time -- don't abruptly change what you are expecting Him 
<a name="l29"></a>to do.
<a name="l30"></a>
<a name="l31"></a>Oujia-board letter mode sucks -- it's pretty funny that a technical problem 
<a name="l32"></a>would prevent discovery.  Random words are better.  Random passages are good.  
<a name="l33"></a>The mistake with a magic eightball is... first, all you can expect is delightful 
<a name="l34"></a>conversation from God and a magic eightball can't really respond to context.  
<a name="l35"></a>You get out of it the love you put into it.
<a name="l36"></a>
<a name="l37"></a>God says...

<a name="l57"></a>know about epic.

<a name="l60"></a>
<a name="l61"></a>So, just randomly cracking open physical books and placing a finger down works 
<a name="l62"></a>well for me, as long as I have done an offering -- being charming and witty or 
<a name="l63"></a>whatever -- and established a context of conversation.
<a name="l64"></a>
<a name="l65"></a>I have noticed when I have not used physical books for a while, God seems a 
<a name="l66"></a>little cold.  Maybe, it's my imagination.
<a name="l67"></a>
<a name="l68"></a>By they way, I don't like people thinking of &quot;getting in the zone&quot;, a mental 
<a name="l69"></a>state, instead focus on what you have offered.
<a name="l70"></a>
<a name="l71"></a>God says...

<a name="l73"></a>cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall
<a name="l74"></a>be mine: I am the LORD.
<a name="l75"></a>
<a name="l76"></a>3:46 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
<a name="l77"></a>threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel,
<a name="l78"></a>which are more than the Levites; 3:47 Thou shalt even take five
<a name="l79"></a>shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt

<a name="l82"></a>
<a name="l83"></a>The question of which numbers can come-up when you use a PC stopwatch program is 
<a name="l84"></a>tricky.  Some clocks only give multiples of 16, so you must divide by 16.  
<a name="l85"></a>Similar, more complicated, issues might exist.  I don't know.  One time, it was 
<a name="l86"></a>a miracle it even sorta worked, when I discovered a crippling bug!

<a name="l90"></a>side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.
<a name="l91"></a>
<a name="l92"></a>41:2 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the
<a name="l93"></a>door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other
<a name="l94"></a>side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the
<a name="l95"></a>breadth, twenty cubits.
<a name="l96"></a>
<a name="l97"></a>41:3 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
<a name="l98"></a>cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven
<a name="l99"></a>cubits.

<a name="l104"></a>
<a name="l105"></a>I think these are figurative, kinda.
<a name="l106"></a>
<a name="l107"></a></span><span class=cF2>19:11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.
<a name="l108"></a>
<a name="l109"></a>And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the
<a name="l110"></a>mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD
<a name="l111"></a>was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD
<a name="l112"></a>was not in the earthquake: 19:12 And after the earthquake a fire; but
<a name="l113"></a>the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
<a name="l114"></a>
<a name="l115"></a>19:13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in
<a name="l116"></a>his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.
<a name="l117"></a>And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou
<a name="l118"></a>here, Elijah?  19:14 And he said, I have been very jealous for the
<a name="l119"></a>LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy
<a name="l120"></a>covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the
<a name="l121"></a>sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it
<a name="l122"></a>away.

<a name="l125"></a>
<a name="l126"></a>Yeah, I'm sure most people want prophecy and talking to dead people.  They don't 
<a name="l127"></a>love God, what an insult.
<a name="l128"></a>
<a name="l129"></a>The technical skills on the other (God's) end are extraordinary.  To drive a 
<a name="l130"></a>stopwatch program or all the different quantum-random-number sites is very 
<a name="l131"></a>difficult, super-human.
<a name="l132"></a>
<a name="l133"></a>The Bible speaks of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.  It says not to prepare your 
<a name="l134"></a>words, the spirit will give them.  It says a die cast in the lap is the Lord.
