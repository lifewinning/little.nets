<a name="l37"></a>I ate a really good frozen microwaved pot pie.  Normally, when eating, you get a 
<a name="l38"></a>bit of gristle or bone or a hair -- usually, there's something that's a downer.  
<a name="l39"></a>Today, I decided to notice when there's nothing bad.
<a name="l40"></a>
<a name="l41"></a>I send emails to Gordon Ramsay telling him he should be CEO.  Normally, I'd 
<a name="l42"></a>kinda look down on fancy foods, but offering three star experince is to be 
<a name="l43"></a>respected.  It's something to think about in software.  One time, God said bugs 
<a name="l44"></a>were bad because they upset customers.  You might say bugs are sins.  Tears on 
<a name="l45"></a>Christmas sounds bad.  The Bible says not to ruin the mood when someone is 
<a name="l46"></a>cheerful.
<a name="l47"></a>
<a name="l48"></a>God likes soap operas best on TV.  Surely, He likes Ramsay?  I think foods

<a name="l69"></a>aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto
<a name="l70"></a>the same maid, to profane my holy name: 2:8 And they lay themselves
<a name="l71"></a>down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the
<a name="l72"></a>wine of the condemned in the house of their god.
<a name="l73"></a>
<a name="l74"></a>2:9 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the
<a name="l75"></a>height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed
<a name="l76"></a>his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
<a name="l77"></a>
<a name="l78"></a>2:10 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty
<a name="l79"></a>years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
<a name="l80"></a>
<a name="l81"></a>2:11 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men
<a name="l82"></a>for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the
<a name="l83"></a>LORD.
<a name="l84"></a>

<a name="l88"></a>The part about turn aside the meek is about Knights who say Ni.  It's about

<a name="l90"></a>
<a name="l91"></a>It could be more serious -- reminds me of Nazis.  Giving the Nazi's wine to
