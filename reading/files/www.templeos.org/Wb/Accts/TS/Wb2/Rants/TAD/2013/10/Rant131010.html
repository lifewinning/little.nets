<a name="l42"></a>1) VMware again supports PC Speaker and provides emulation if no PC Speaker.

<a name="l45"></a>Then, I can remove FAT32 and ISO9660.  (I might want to change clusters to just

<a name="l1051"></a>the classic sense?  God really really likes that stuff.  He doesn't like flat, 
<a name="l1052"></a>lowest level stuff, but things that soar.  You can get the knack for soaring.  
<a name="l1053"></a>It's frustrating, though, because I lose control and say unintended things,
