<a name="l23"></a>in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
<a name="l24"></a>
<a name="l25"></a>17:17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
<a name="l26"></a>the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with
<a name="l27"></a>him.
<a name="l28"></a>
<a name="l29"></a>17:18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
<a name="l30"></a>encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other
<a name="l31"></a>some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he
<a name="l32"></a>preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
<a name="l33"></a>
<a name="l34"></a>17:19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
<a name="l35"></a>we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  17:20 For
<a name="l36"></a>thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know
<a name="l37"></a>therefore what these things mean.
<a name="l38"></a>

<a name="l42"></a>The horse is the man.  The carriage is the woman.  Men do the action of 
<a name="l43"></a>courtship, but women actually make the decision.  It's as though the woman is 
<a name="l44"></a>chasing the man, but the man is doing the work.  The man might think he is 
<a name="l45"></a>chasing -- it sure seems like it.  And it's at a fixed distance.

<a name="l60"></a>
<a name="l61"></a>I'm kinda shell shocked, right now.  Lots of iintense earlier events and I know 
<a name="l62"></a>not where we stand.
<a name="l63"></a>
<a name="l64"></a>BBC is talking.  Does Britain know it's God?
<a name="l65"></a>
<a name="l66"></a>I've learned a lot about psychology. &lt;chuckle&gt;
<a name="l67"></a>
<a name="l68"></a>&quot;No, it's not God because God does not exist.&quot;
<a name="l69"></a>
<a name="l70"></a>Lovely.  Ten years and that's where we're at?  Sigh.

<a name="l72"></a>----10/16/13 01:37:29----
<a name="l73"></a>
<a name="l74"></a>The radio talks to me.  Reality is unusual.  At Graphic Technologies, it was the 
<a name="l75"></a>Truman Show.  I was red team for the CIA.  I had to counter anti-refill chips 
<a name="l76"></a>for printer cartridges and the CIA observed and made it harder, but not too 
<a name="l77"></a>hard.  There is some cosmic reason not to make it too hard.  When they do 
<a name="l78"></a>encryption, I think they make it so supercomputers can do it, but not too hard.  
<a name="l79"></a>So, Ken was a coworker whom I didn't like.  He broke my high speed parallel port 
<a name="l80"></a>card and I couldn't get another.  The CIA banned such cards.  They do not want 
<a name="l81"></a>high speed digital I/O for PCs.
<a name="l82"></a>
<a name="l83"></a>Everything is controlled by the CIA.  My graphic in my operating system are 
<a name="l84"></a>awful.  It's probably the CIA.  I heard a roomer of 57 Ghz chips.
<a name="l85"></a>
<a name="l86"></a>I guess they won't listen to God.  I wonder what they think of God? 
<a name="l87"></a>Retard-niggers in denial?  Pathetic -- ten years.

<a name="l702"></a>One day I got frustrated because I had not carefully chosen U64 vs I64.  Instead 
<a name="l703"></a>of carefully going through all my code, I changed all of them to I64.  I tested 
<a name="l704"></a>my code and whatever was broken, I changed back to U64.
<a name="l705"></a>
<a name="l706"></a>Consistency is next to Godliness.
<a name="l707"></a>
<a name="l708"></a>You, now, know the true reason, but here's my excuse -- in BASIC and similar 
<a name="l709"></a>beginner languages, you have just one integer.  People should always pick I64, 
<a name="l710"></a>unless physically breaks.  There are a few really obnoxious results to this 
<a name="l711"></a>policy.
<a name="l712"></a>
<a name="l713"></a>I don't see how you can simplify MAlloc() and Free() to be any simpler.  I am 
<a name="l714"></a>not a fan of whatever magic they do to hide MAlloc().  A liberal wants to 
<a name="l715"></a>protect the poor kids from the brutal world of ones and zeros of MAlloc() and 
<a name="l716"></a>pointers.  Guess what?  Now, you have two problems and a clusterfucked thing you 
<a name="l717"></a>will eventually have to explain.
<a name="l718"></a>
<a name="l719"></a>Lots of evil comes from liberals wanting to protect young minds from... the real 
<a name="l720"></a>way things work.  They are &quot;proud of heart&quot;.
<a name="l721"></a>
<a name="l722"></a>I don't really advocate this, but you could teach 6502 assembly language as an 
<a name="l723"></a>introduction to computers in 8th grade.  It's not complicated -- it's simple.  
<a name="l724"></a>It's so simple it's complicated.
<a name="l725"></a>
<a name="l726"></a>It seems like people got the scent of &quot;protect young minds from the real way 
<a name="l727"></a>it's done.&quot;  Now, there is a stampede of people jumping on the band wagon of 
<a name="l728"></a>ever-more protecting the young people from the way it's really done.
<a name="l729"></a>
<a name="l730"></a>I have a feeling it's FUBAR.  Fucked-up beyond all recognition.  Good intentions 
<a name="l731"></a>-- treating all kids as black and unable to learn.  The liberals.
<a name="l732"></a>
<a name="l733"></a>Sometimes, I actually think Bill Gates is an evil fucker, quite honestly.  &quot;Oh 
<a name="l734"></a>you don't need to learn that, as he fills minds with poisoned warped shit that 
<a name="l735"></a>will cripple them.&quot;
<a name="l736"></a>
<a name="l737"></a>You know?  A spread-sheet is an unnatural construct.
<a name="l738"></a>
<a name="l739"></a>Functional programming is unnatural.
<a name="l740"></a>
<a name="l741"></a>SQL is pretty unnatural.  (It's necessary, though.)
<a name="l742"></a>
<a name="l743"></a>The best word for these is &quot;convoluted&quot; and contrary to normal sequenced 
<a name="l744"></a>thought.
<a name="l745"></a>
<a name="l746"></a>I did a report generator for Ticketmaster.  You had to do convoluted constructs.
<a name="l747"></a>
<a name="l748"></a>The poor business people who are not programmers have to learn spread sheets or 
<a name="l749"></a>whatever -- some nasty unnatural language.
<a name="l750"></a>
<a name="l751"></a>I feel sorry for them, but I guess we can't teach them natural programming 
<a name="l752"></a>earlier.
<a name="l753"></a>
<a name="l754"></a>Zuckerberg want everyone to learn to program.  Yeah, I was young and thought 
<a name="l755"></a>that.  Now, I don't think that, I guess.

<a name="l945"></a>God says...
<a name="l946"></a></span><span class=cF4>world, but was manifest in these last times for you, 1:21 Who by him
<a name="l947"></a>do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him
<a name="l948"></a>glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
<a name="l949"></a>
<a name="l950"></a>1:22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
<a name="l951"></a>the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one
<a name="l952"></a>another with a pure heart fervently: 1:23 Being born again, not of
<a name="l953"></a>corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which
<a name="l954"></a>liveth and abideth for ever.
<a name="l955"></a>
<a name="l956"></a>1:24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower
<a name="l957"></a>of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:
<a name="l958"></a>1:25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
<a name="l959"></a>which by the gospel is preached unto you.
<a name="l960"></a>
<a name="l961"></a>2:1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
<a name="l962"></a>and envies, all evil speakings, 2:2 As newborn babes, desire the
<a name="l963"></a>sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: 2:3 If so be ye
<a name="l964"></a>have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</span><span class=cF0>

<a name="l968"></a>A guy suggested asking God what to do in Washington.  I think what has to be 
<a name="l969"></a>accepted is lots of times there are no good answers or it would be easy to 
<a name="l970"></a>decide.
<a name="l971"></a>
<a name="l972"></a>Here's what ya do!  God does equal exchange of offering and response.  If you 
<a name="l973"></a>senators really want God's help, praise Him or do a hymn or something.  You'll 
<a name="l974"></a>get equal value.  Depressing, LOL.  That's probably worthless, isn't it, if the 
<a name="l975"></a>solution is valued in billions.  Who knows how this works, though.
<a name="l976"></a>
<a name="l977"></a>This is not my habit, but many people in the Bible made vows to trade God for 
<a name="l978"></a>stuff.  You really have to bargain with God.
<a name="l979"></a>
<a name="l980"></a>In Nineva when Jonah spoke, all the people put-on sackcloth and ashes and 
<a name="l981"></a>fasted.
<a name="l982"></a>
<a name="l983"></a>I'll do a poem.
<a name="l984"></a>
<a name="l985"></a>Can't think of any poems.
<a name="l986"></a>
<a name="l987"></a>Absurd misplaced logic feels weird.  Can you exchange completely off topic 
<a name="l988"></a>stuff?

<a name="l995"></a>God says...
<a name="l996"></a></span><span class=cF4>5:5 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the
<a name="l997"></a>night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let
<a name="l998"></a>down the net.
<a name="l999"></a>
<a name="l1000"></a>5:6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of
<a name="l1001"></a>fishes: and their net brake.
<a name="l1002"></a>
<a name="l1003"></a>5:7 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
<a name="l1004"></a>ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled
<a name="l1005"></a>both the ships, so that they began to sink.
<a name="l1006"></a>
<a name="l1007"></a>5:8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
<a name="l1008"></a>Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
<a name="l1009"></a>
<a name="l1010"></a>5:9 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught
<a name="l1011"></a>of the fishes which they had taken: 5:10 And so was also James, and
<a name="l1012"></a>John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus
<a name="l1013"></a>said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</span><span class=cF0>
