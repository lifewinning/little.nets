<a name="l49"></a>
<a name="l50"></a>OSDev and all media have talked to me over the years.  I get puzzled when the 
<a name="l51"></a>delusion fails.  I read it and all of a sudden, it doesn't seem to talk to me.  
<a name="l52"></a>They are talking to a noob about VGA mode.  They tell him VGA mode has nothing 
<a name="l53"></a>to do with real mode.  I've been in long mode since 2007 -- can be proven on the 
<a name="l54"></a>Internet Archive.  I'm kinda disappointed -- this delusion sucks.  I want my 
<a name="l55"></a>money back.  It's delicious when they underestimate me.  I get to clobber them 
<a name="l56"></a>with my brilliance.  This time seems kinda lame.
<a name="l57"></a>
<a name="l58"></a>I think they doubt I did text in 640x480 16 color mode.  Maybe, they want to 
<a name="l59"></a>raise an issue over my 8x8 font's copywrite.  A psychologist predicts trains of 
<a name="l60"></a>thought.
<a name="l61"></a>
<a name="l62"></a>I'm a little disappointed and bored I don't have a delusion, but I'm doing okay.
<a name="l63"></a>
<a name="l64"></a>Does he think I lie about making 8x8 text in VGA 640x480 mode.  I think he 
<a name="l65"></a>thinks I lie about making text.  In 1983, I wrote a 6502 assembly routine to 
<a name="l66"></a>plot a high-res pix.  It's harder than it looks because the commodore screen 
<a name="l67"></a>memory when down 8 bytes for a character and left for the next character and 
<a name="l68"></a>down 8 bytes.  The screen memory was oriented like characters were laid-out.  I 
<a name="l69"></a>wrote a 6502 asm when I was 13 to plot a pix.
<a name="l70"></a>
<a name="l71"></a>VGA has 4 bit-planes.  We actually studied this in CSC226.
<a name="l72"></a>
<a name="l73"></a>Sigh.
<a name="l74"></a>
<a name="l75"></a>If they think I'm that far behind, it's gonna be cool when they discover its 
<a name="l76"></a>long mode and that I wrote a 64-bit compiler.
<a name="l77"></a>
<a name="l78"></a>&quot;protected mode&quot; is higher level talk for the CIA keeping our enemies stuck.  
<a name="l79"></a>It's not worth it.  I'm not a coward.  God is perfectly just.
